# Per-model prompting reference (recipes)

**Source.** This file is **adapted** from
[SlavaSexton/ComfyUI-Agent-Kit `shared/comfyui/MODELS.md`](https://github.com/SlavaSexton/ComfyUI-Agent-Kit)
(MIT). Every `###` heading below carries a YAML frontmatter block that binds
each model to: id, family, modality, prompt dialect, negative-prompt policy,
trigger tokens, license, and a sample prompt.

**How to use it (the auto-pull rule).** When a specific model is named in the
request, the workflow, or the template, READ that model's entry below BEFORE
writing the prompt, and follow its structure, its negative-prompt rule, and its
settings. Do not carry one model's prompt style over to another (SDXL tags
will not help FLUX; FLUX prose will not help SDXL).

**Provenance.** All recipe bodies are preserved verbatim from the upstream
file. Only YAML frontmatter is added.
# Per-model prompting reference

**This reference is distilled from official sources** (each model maker's docs / model card, docs.comfy.org, and
the per-model prompt templates shipped with the `anthropic-claude` ComfyUI node). Each generative model has its
own "character" and rewards a different prompt approach. Treat every model as its own dialect.

**How to use it (the auto-pull rule):** when a specific model is named in the request, the workflow, or the
template, READ that model's entry below BEFORE writing the prompt, and follow its structure, its negative-prompt
rule, and its settings. Do not carry one model's prompt style over to another (SDXL tags will not help FLUX;
FLUX prose will not help SDXL).

sample_prompts:
  - "Prompt style:** natural-language sentences, not comma tags."
---

### FLUX.1 (Black Forest Labs)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language sentences, not comma tags. Word order matters (earlier tokens weighted more).
- **Structure:** Subject -> Action/Pose -> Style/Medium -> Context/Environment -> Technical details; most important first. Rendered text in quotes (keep under ~25 chars); hex codes tied to specific objects work.
- **Strengths:** native text rendering, photorealism via real camera/lens/film language, hex color control, multilingual.
- **Avoid:** negative prompts NOT supported on any FLUX.1 version (may add the unwanted element); no named fonts (describe the style).
- **Settings:** Schnell 1-4 steps / guidance ~3.0 / ~1MP; Dev 20-50 steps / guidance 1.5-5.0 / ~2MP; Pro/Ultra API. ComfyUI: FluxGuidance node, euler/simple typical.
- **Source:** docs.bfl.ml ; node template `flux.md`.

sample_prompts:
  - "InpaintStitchImproved"
  - "ComfyUI-Flux2Klein-Enhancer"
---

### FLUX.2 (Black Forest Labs)
- **Prompt style:** natural language OR JSON structured (natural for iteration, JSON for precise production control).
- **Structure:** main subject -> key action -> critical style -> essential context -> secondary details.
- **Strengths:** photorealism, text rendering, hex color, product shots, native multilingual; multi-reference compositing (pro up to 8, flex ~10, dev ~6) with identity/style/pose typing.
- **Avoid:** negative prompts NOT supported.
- **Settings:** API for pro/max/flex; FLUX.2 [dev] open-weight runs locally (guidance/steps per the dev workflow).
- **Field recipes (community):** **Klein masked inpaint + dual reference** (Flux.2 [Klein]): `InpaintStitchImproved`
  (comfyui-inpaint-cropandstitch) + a mask + two reference images, one prompt-driven and one ref+mask driven, for
  controlled edits. **1-click multi-angle character turnarounds:** a prompt-batcher fans one character into several camera
  angles for consistency. **Multi-reference identity lock, training-free** (Flux.2 [Klein] 9B): the
  `ComfyUI-Flux2Klein-Enhancer` suite (capitan01R, ~510 stars as of 2026-06) does identity-preserving multi-subject
  edits with NO LoRA training. Core node **Identity Feature Transfer Final** patches Klein attention output
  (`set_model_attn1_output_patch`) to transfer features from up to 8 VAE-encoded reference latents (fed via **Multi
  ReferenceLatent**), with per-reference masks (`subject_mask_1..8`), similarity matching, and confidence-gated
  transfer across Klein's 8 double + 24 single blocks, presets HARD/MID/SOFT_LOCK. Companions: **Color Anchor**
  (post-CFG channel-mean color match), **Sectioned Encoder + Detail Controller** (FRONT/MID/END prompt-section
  weights), **Ref / Mask Ref Controllers**, and an experimental resolution-aware Euler sampler. No extra Python deps.
  **License: PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 (personal/research free; commercial use needs a separate license).**
  Community workflows, not official BFL recipes.
- **Community fine-tune - Flux2-Klein-9B-True-V3 (wikeeyang):** an aesthetics / composition fine-tune of
  `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9B` (base_model_relation: finetune; card labeled `apache-2.0`, en/zh,
  text-to-image). V3 markedly improves aesthetics and composition over V1/V2 per the card's comparison grids. It
  does text-to-image, prompt-only **instruct editing** (edit an input image from a plain instruction, no
  ControlNet), and with a companion LoRA **face-swap / try-on / try-off** (`bfs_head_v1` at ~0.75) plus **Mask +
  LoRA** regional editing. Prompt it like Flux.2 [Klein]. Ships a wide quant ladder so it fits most cards: `bf16`
  (full), `fp8mixed`, **`int8mixedrow`** (loads with ComfyUI's OFFICIAL / native INT8 loader), **`INT8-ConvRot`**
  (loads NATIVELY as of ComfyUI v0.27.0's int8-convrot support - the Milor123 quant pre-dated that via the now-superseded `ComfyUI-INT8-Fast`; see ADVANCED.md "INT8 acceleration"), `mxfp8`, `nvfp4`, and GGUF
  `Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K/Q8_0`; the card claims INT8 is ~2x faster than fp8 at low quality loss (see ADVANCED.md "INT8
  acceleration"). LICENSE CAVEAT (inferred): the card is tagged Apache-2.0, but the weights derive from FLUX.2
  [Klein] - confirm the base Klein license before commercial use rather than trusting the fine-tune's tag alone.

- **360 / VR equirectangular panorama IMAGE (Flux.2 Klein, via panorama-stickers):** turn Flux.2 Klein into a
  360 equirectangular (ERP) panorama generator. The model-agnostic **`nomadoor/ComfyUI-Panorama-Stickers`** pack
  (MIT, Comfy Registry v1.3.0; its four ERP nodes - Stickers / Cutout / Preview / Seam Prep - are broken down in
  `NODE_LIBRARY/custom-author.md`) provides the ERP canvas, cutout, seam-prep and interactive preview. Grow a
  normal image into a seamless 360 sphere with nomadoor's own outpaint LoRAs:
  **`nomadoor/flux-2-klein-4B-360-erp-outpaint-lora`** (`apache-2.0`, base Klein 4B) or **`...-9B-...`**
  (`license: other`, base Klein 9B); ready graphs `flux-2-klein-{4B,9B}-360-erp-outpaint.json` ship in the repo.
  The SAME pack (v1.3.0+ video support) previews the separate LTX-2.3 360 VIDEO route. NOTE - two different
  "Flux.2 Klein" things:
  nomadoor's 360-outpaint LoRA (this entry) is UNRELATED to wikeeyang's Flux2-Klein-9B-True-V3 general fine-tune

sample_prompts:
  - "score_9, score_8_up, 1girl, golden hair, elf ears, casting fireball, [character tags], [scene tags], [style tags]"
---

### Anima (miaomiaoHarem / AnimaStandardV7)
- **Prompt style:** tag-based (Danbooru-style comma-separated tags), score-prefixed. Strong prompt adherence; works best with `score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up` quality prefixes + specific character/scene tags.
- **Structure:** score prefix -> character tags -> appearance tags -> clothing -> action -> scene -> lighting -> style/artist. Weighted tokens `(tag:1.2)` supported.
- **Strengths:** anime/manga illustration, strong character consistency via LoRA stack, Chinese-preferring name canon. Default flow in this plugin = AnimaStandardV7.json (73 nodes).
- **Avoid:** natural-language sentences (it's a tag model, not FLUX); over-long prompts (>256 tokens degrade); missing score prefix (quality drops).
- **Settings (AnimaStandardV7 default):** 30 steps / CFG 4.5 / dpmpp_2m / karras / 832x1216. Fixed LoRA stack: `gpt-image-2_anima-base1_v1-1`, `anima-base-1-masterpiece-v51`, `细节调整`. Text encoder: `qwen_3_06b_base.safetensors`. VAE: `qwen_image_vae.safetensors`. Negative prompts SUPPORTED (unlike FLUX): `worst quality,low quality,score_1,score_2,score_3,artist name,blurry,jpeg artifacts,lowres,censor`.
- **Detailer:** AnimaStandardV7 has built-in DetailerForEach + HandDetailer + NSFWDetailer + FaceDetailer + hiresFix (4x_foolhardy_Remacri) — no separate upscale pass needed.
- **Source:** this plugin's manga-stage-2-panels SKILL + workflow-resolver.md (AnimaStandardV7.json).

---

### FLUX.1 Kontext (image edit)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language instructions (tell it what to change, like instructing a person).
- **Structure:** "Change/Replace/Add/Remove [target] to/with [description]"; add preservation language ("keeping the pose unchanged"); one focused edit per instruction; text edits in quotes.
- **Strengths:** outfit/background swaps, object add/remove, text editing (Max = best typography), character identity + style transfer.
- **Avoid:** "don't" instructions (rephrase positively); stacking many complex edits; re-describing the whole image.
- **Settings:** Dev open-weight (local); Pro/Max API.

sample_prompts:
  - "2.1-2602-8steps"
  - "control_context_scale"
---

### Z-Image-Turbo (Tongyi / Alibaba)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language descriptive, subject-first; no special token syntax. Optional LLM prompt-enhancement template in the repo.
- **Strengths:** photorealism, accurate bilingual (EN/CN) text, strong instruction adherence, sub-second on 16GB VRAM.
- **Avoid:** negative prompts not used (CFG-distilled); high CFG (4+) degrades results.
- **Settings:** 9 steps (8 DiT forwards) per the official card; CFG 0.0 per the official card (community ComfyUI guides ~1.5-2.0 if any); torch_dtype bfloat16 (official); 1024x1024 best (2K direct can distort, upscale + second pass at ~0.3 denoise); community sampler euler_ancestral or dpmpp_sde, scheduler sgm_uniform.
- **Source:** huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo ; docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/z-image/z-image-turbo.
- **ControlNet (Fun-Controlnet-Union, alibaba-pai, Apache-2.0):** union ControlNet for Z-Image-Turbo; modes Canny / Depth / Pose / HED / MLSD (+ Scribble in the 2601 build, + Gray in 2602), plus an inpaint mode. Use the distilled `2.1-2602-8steps` variant at 8 steps (the non-distilled 2.0/2.1 lose Turbo's acceleration and then need more steps + cfg). Main knob `control_context_scale` 0.65-1.00 (higher = stronger control and better detail preservation); a detailed prompt helps stability. ComfyUI wiring: load the weights with `ModelPatchLoader`, apply with a DiffSynth ControlNet node (`QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet` in the reference graph; confirm the exact node/pack against `/object_info`). Source: huggingface.co/alibaba-pai/Z-Image-Turbo-Fun-Controlnet-Union-2.1 ; github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun.
- **Upscale (two options, pick by need):** (1) hires-fix / controlnet-locked: resize up (lanczos 2x) then a Z-Image-Turbo img2img refine with the Union ControlNet locking composition. VERIFIED by testing: the ControlNet holds STRUCTURE (pose, framing, edges) but Z-Image still regenerates content, so at denoise ~0.4-0.7 a real person's face drifts to a similar-but-different identity (structure preserved, identity NOT). Keep denoise ~0.2 to stay faithful (little detail gain), or treat this mode as stylize/enhance, not identity-faithful SR. (2) real super-resolution: the companion `Z-Image-Turbo-Fun-Controlnet-Tile-2.1-2601-8steps` Tile model, trained to 2048x2048 for SR, 8 steps, tiled so structure holds WITHOUT reinterpreting; this is the faithful path. For an identity-locked face upscale, prefer a GAN (Real-ESRGAN) or the Tile model, optionally with a face-ID adapter (PuLID/InstantID). Cost / gotchas: needs the controlnet checkpoint(s) + custom nodes (DiffSynth ControlNet apply node, KJNodes `ImageResizeKJv2`, rgthree Power Lora Loader; core `Canny` or controlnet_aux for the control image); a single high-res pass with the FULL 6.7GB control model is VRAM-heavy and offloads (a ~2.7K refine OOM-crashed a running server on a 24GB card), so cap the target resolution or use the lite control model.

### Qwen-Image (Alibaba)
- **Prompt style:** structured natural language, not tag dumps.
- **Structure:** Subject -> Style -> Details -> Composition -> Lighting; choose ONE primary style; add framing or it defaults centered; exact text in quotes with font/position.
- **Strengths:** commercial-grade text in 26+ languages, posters/infographics/layouts, human realism (2512), natural textures.
- **Avoid:** negatives accepted but inconsistent; long text passages degrade; contradictory styles confuse it.
- **Settings:** base ~20+ steps, sampler euler or res_multistep, CFG 5-7 (text/production), 25-45 steps text-heavy; distilled 15 steps CFG 1.0; 8-step Lightning-LoRA at 8 steps; max prompt ~800 chars.

### Qwen-Image-Edit (Alibaba)
- **Prompt style:** surgical natural-language instructions, describe only the change.
- **Structure:** "Add/Remove/Change [element + color/size/orientation] [position]"; text edits in English double quotes; reference inputs by number ("Image 1", up to 3 in 2509+); keep 50-200 chars.
- **Strengths:** add/remove/replace, background swap, style transfer, bilingual text editing, portrait/pose edits, multi-image fusion, old-photo restoration.
- **Avoid:** negative prompts NOT supported (use a single space if a field is required); no mask inpainting/outpainting.
- **Settings:** true_cfg_scale 4.0 (4-5), num_inference_steps 50 (20-30 previews), guidance_scale 1.0; node TextEncodeQwenImageEdit + official edit workflow.
- **SDR -> HDR (single image): LumiPic** (`oumoumad/LumiPic`, MIT) - a LoRA that turns any SDR image into a
  scene-linear HDR EXR, the IMAGE analog of the LTX-2.3 HDR IC-LoRA (SAME LumiVid paper, arXiv 2604.11788; see the
  LTX-2.3 HDR entry): the DiT is trained to output an ARRI-LogC-encoded `[0,1]` frame through a frozen VAE, which
  is then inverse-LogC'd to linear HDR (values well past 1.0). Base-model-agnostic; three bases -
  **Qwen-Image-Edit-2511** (mature, production default, 563 MB LoRA, ~54 GB base; default `v5b_step2000`,
  natural-photo alt `v9_step1500`), **FLUX.2 [Klein] 4B** (alpha, 88 MB, apache-2.0 base, fastest;
  `klein4b_alpha_step1750`) and **9B** (alpha, 158 MB, gated base; `klein9b_alpha_step2000`, sweet spot
  `step1250`). Two curves: **LogC3** (stable, linear ceiling ~55, ~8.3 stops) and **LogC4** (V10 alpha, ceiling
  ~470, ~3 extra highlight stops - the `*_logc4_*` files). ComfyUI: ready graphs on the HF repo
  (`SDR_To_HDR_{QE11,klein4b,klein9b,logc4_klein9b}.json`), drop the LoRA in `models/loras/{qwen,flux-2}/hdr/`,
  install **`ComfyUI_Gear`** >= v0.2.0 (its LogC3 / LogC4 Decode + Save EXR node writes the EXR - see
  `NODE_LIBRARY/custom-author.md`), prompt "Convert this image to HDR". MATCH the decode node to the LoRA curve
  (`_logc4_*` -> LogC4 node, everything else -> LogC3) or the absolute luminance is silently wrong. HONEST CAVEAT
  (from the card): V10 LogC4 is alpha - the Qwen V10 gain shows in diffusers but NOT yet in ComfyUI (looks weaker
  than V9); `klein4b_v10_logc4_step1500` is the LogC4 checkpoint that holds up in ComfyUI. For an ACEScg pipeline,
  decode LogC3 with our OCIO `OCIOLogConvert(logc3)` then `OCIOColorSpace(Rec.709 -> ACEScg)` (Gear keeps the
  source primaries; ADVANCED.md has the tie-in). Source: huggingface.co/oumoumad/LumiPic ;

### SDXL (Stability)
- **Prompt style:** natural language preferred (dual encoder), short comma tags work as hybrid.
- **Structure:** subject + descriptors + style + quality/medium + lighting.
- **Strengths:** 1024-native coherence, better hands/anatomy than SD1.5, huge LoRA/ControlNet ecosystem.
- **Avoid:** negatives supported and effectively required (no built-in quality filter); never generate at 512x512.
- **Settings:** 1024x1024 (or 832x1216, etc.); ~25-40 steps; CFG ~5-8 (~7); sampler DPM++ 2M / Euler a + Karras; optional base->refiner split at the official 80/20 ratio (`high_noise_frac=0.8`: `denoising_end=0.8` on base, `denoising_start=0.8` on refiner, n_steps=40, per the card example).

### Stable Diffusion 1.5
- **Prompt style:** comma-separated tags / keyword-driven; `(token:1.2)` weighting works.
- **Structure:** subject tags -> descriptor tags -> style/quality tags.
- **Strengths:** speed, low VRAM, massive community models/LoRAs/embeddings.
- **Avoid:** negatives supported and heavily used ("blurry, lowres, bad anatomy, watermark"); don't generate far above 512 natively (use hi-res fix); weak hands/text.
- **Settings:** 512x512 native, guidance ~7 (community default; the official card prescribes NO single CFG, it only evaluates a 1.5-8.0 range), 50 PNDM/PLMS steps (community ~20-30 steps, CFG 7); samplers Euler a / DPM++ 2M Karras.

### Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (Stability)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language sentences (trained on natural language; handles them far better than SD1.5/SDXL).
- **Structure:** Style, Subject + Action, Composition/Framing, Lighting/Color, Technical, Text integration, Negative; ~1MP, dimensions divisible by 64.
- **Avoid:** keyword weighting and bracket/emphasis syntax do NOT work, write plain natural language.
- **Settings:** steps 28 (official example; community up to ~40), guidance 3.5-4.5 (4.5 complex); max_sequence_length 512 for the long / quantized-prompt path; SD3-family nodes; ~1MP divisible by 64.
- **Download:** GATED on HF, accept the license + use a token to download (Stability AI Community License form at huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large before the weights are accessible). License: free for orgs / individuals under $1M annual revenue, enterprise license required above that.

### HiDream-I1
- **Prompt style:** natural-language (multi-encoder incl. an LLM text encoder); no prescribed tag format.
- **Strengths:** state-of-the-art prompt adherence and quality (DPG-Bench 85.89, GenEval 0.83), good text rendering.
- **Avoid:** negative-prompt support not documented; Full (CFG-guided) can use them, Dev/Fast run at guidance 0.0 so negatives are inert.
- **Settings:** Full 50 steps guidance 5.0; Dev 28 steps guidance 0.0; Fast 16 steps guidance 0.0; ComfyUI HiDream sampler nodes.
- **Setup:** requires Flash Attention installed (a hard dependency, not optional) + CUDA 12.4 recommended; inference auto-downloads `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` as the LLM text encoder, which needs a separate HF token with Meta Llama access approved at huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.

### Boogu Image 0.1
- **Prompt style:** natural-language descriptive (Qwen3-VL-8B text encoder); a built-in prompt rewriter (instruction reasoner, Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct) expands terse inputs, so plain prompts work but detail steers better.
- **Structure:** subject + scene + style + lighting + composition in complete sentences; the VLM encoder favors natural language over tags.
- **Strengths:** open-weight Apache-2.0 (commercial-OK, not gated); three variants - Base (quality), Turbo (few-step distilled, competitive with Z-Image-Turbo), Edit (instruction image edit at 1K/1.5K/2K); rides the Qwen3-VL stack + FLUX VAE.
- **Avoid:** no tag-weighting / bracket syntax (natural language only); negative-prompt support not documented.
- **Settings:** Base ~50 steps, text_guidance 4.0; Turbo is few-step distilled (ships a turbo LoRA `boogu_image_turbo_lora_rank_128`); Edit at 1K / 1.5K / 2K.
- **ComfyUI build:** official templates `image_boogu_image_0_1_turbo_t2i.json` (t2i) and `image_boogu_image_0_1_edit.json` (edit). Comfy-Org repack `huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Boogu-Image`: `diffusion_models/boogu_image_{base,turbo,edit}_fp8_scaled` (bf16 / nvfp4 also) + `text_encoders/qwen3vl_8b_fp8_scaled` + `vae/flux1_vae` (the FLUX ae). GGUF for low VRAM: `realrebelai/Boogu-Image-{Turbo,Edit}_GGUFs`.

---

### Ideogram (2.x to 4.0)
- **Nodes available (ComfyUI v0.28.0):** only **`IdeogramV3`** and **`IdeogramV4`** ship now. The old **`IdeogramV1` and `IdeogramV2` nodes were REMOVED in v0.28.0** (Comfy-Org PR #14712), so an older graph that loads them will fail to resolve the node; rebuild it on V3 / V4. Confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_ideogram.py` on master (only V3, V4 and the extension are defined) plus the v0.28.0 release notes.
- **Prompt style:** natural-language sentences (no tags, no `--ar`/`::` flags); typography specialist.
- **Structure:** describe as to a person; important elements and text early; exact text in quotes (under ~25 chars), describe font style/position/color, don't name fonts.
- **Strengths:** quoted-text rendering, posters/logos/signage; `DESIGN` style for typography, `REALISTIC` for photos.
- **Avoid:** long text strings, burying text mid-prompt, naming fonts. Negative prompts ARE supported (`negative_prompt`; positive takes precedence).
- **Settings (API):** `style_type`, `rendering_speed` (TURBO/DEFAULT/QUALITY), `magic_prompt`, aspect ratios, seed, up to 4 images/call, character & style refs.
- **Structured / JSON prompting (Ideogram 4) - two real paths:**
  - **Base node:** **`IdeogramV4`** ("Ideogram V4") takes a plain multiline `prompt` (+ a `resolution` combo, `rendering_speed` = `DEFAULT` / `TURBO` / `QUALITY`, and `seed`) -> `SaveImage` (confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_ideogram.py`). The official `api_ideogram_v4_t2i` template expands a short idea into a longer caption with a **`GeminiNode`** "magic prompt" that feeds `IdeogramV4`.
  - **Spatial structured-control path (new core nodes, confirmed from `comfy_extras/nodes_bounding_boxes.py` + `nodes_json_prompt.py` + `nodes_ideogram4.py`):** **`CreateBoundingBoxes`** ("Create Bounding Boxes", category `utilities`) is a visual region editor (drag boxes, grid-snap, colour-pick) with outputs `preview` (IMAGE), `bboxes` (BOUNDING_BOX), `elements` (ARRAY). Wire `elements` into **`BuildJsonPromptIdeogram`** ("Build JSON Prompt (Ideogram)", category `text`) along with `high_level_description`, `background`, `style` (`none` / `photo` / `art_style`), `aesthetics`, `lighting`, `medium`, and a `color_palette` (COLORS, up to 16 hex); it outputs a `prompt` (DICT) caption (`high_level_description` / `style_description` / `compositional_deconstruction`) for Ideogram 4. **`Ideogram4Scheduler`** ("Ideogram 4 Scheduler") is the paired scheduler. Use this to PLACE elements spatially instead of hoping prose lands the layout. These nodes are experimental and very new (the `CreateBoundingBoxes` widget landed in frontend v1.48.2, 2026-07-11), so no official template ships them yet.

- **Structure:** prose covering subject, spatial relationships, lighting/mood, woven-in camera language; exact text in quotes; label each reference by role ("Image 1 is the product").
- **Strengths:** internal reasoning before render, multilingual text + in-image translation, character consistency, reference blending, Google Search grounding (add "using current data"), world-knowledge physics. Up to 11 refs.

### Nano Banana 2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language descriptive prose (same as Pro), speed-optimized (<~20s).
- **Structure:** six elements - subject, composition/camera, action, aspect ratio (state when non-standard), lighting (photographic terms), style; exact text in quotes; label refs; request resolution above default 1K.
- **Strengths:** fast iteration, extended ratios (1:4, 4:1, 1:8, 8:1), tiers 0.5K/1K/2K/4K, web+image Search grounding, up to 14 refs, 360-degree character sheets.
- **Avoid:** keyword dumps, bracket templates, negative phrasing, temperature below 1.0 (loops). Small CJK text and data-viz error-prone; knowledge cutoff Jan 2025 (use grounding).

### Nano Banana 2 Lite (Gemini Flash Image, fast tier)
- **Prompt style:** the same descriptive prose as Nano Banana 2, at a lower quality ceiling; built for volume, not the last 5% of fidelity.
- **Strengths:** the fastest / cheapest Nano Banana tier. Vendor claims from the ComfyUI launch post (treat as marketing): ~4 s per image, ~$0.034 per 1K images. Aimed at high-volume iteration and batch variations (ad-asset batches, 50 concept variants before the brief changes).
- **Run it:** official Comfy partner API nodes / templates `api_nano_banana_2_lite_t2i` (text-to-image) and `api_nano_banana_2_lite_image_edit` (edit), both confirmed in the Comfy-Org/workflow_templates index (a sibling `api_google_nano_banana2_image_edit` also ships).

### Seedream 4.0 / 4.5 (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style:** structured (technical specifications, direct over narrative - the exception among modern models).
- **Structure:** explicit identity-lock descriptors (face, hair, build, clothing) for series; state what's consistent vs variable; exact text in quotes; 50-100 words (range 30-300; cap ~600 EN words / 300 CN chars).
- **Strengths:** up to 15-image sequential batch with identity locking, up to 14 refs, facial-landmark consistency, sharp small-text/logo typography.
- **Avoid:** keyword dumps, flowery language, missing identity-lock descriptors. Describe positively (no explicit negative guidance).

- **Structure:** `[subject + key trait] [action/pose] [environment with spatial relationship] [optional one-phrase style anchor]`; state object relationships; for series state count + consistency; text in double quotes; refs as Figure 1, 2.
- **Strengths:** coherent from short/abstract prompts, web search, stronger identity lock than 4.x, 2560x1440 to 3072x3072 (`auto_2K`/`auto_3K`).
- **Avoid:** CRITICAL - quality boosters ("masterpiece", "8K", "best quality") HARM output (distract the CoT pipeline); no `(word:1.3)` weights; negatives NOT supported; no guidance-scale param.

### Seedream 5.0 Pro (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style:** same natural-language, CoT-reasoning family as 5.0 Lite (relationship-first sentences, NOT keyword lists); state object relationships and, for a series, count + consistency; exact text in double quotes; label refs as Figure 1, 2.
- **Strengths:** ByteDance's latest image model - **multi-modal in ONE node** (text-to-image, precise image editing, multi-image inputs); strong **character + product consistency** (portrait identity / lighting / realism held across style changes and edits); **region-precise editing** (edit a target area, leave lighting / depth / texture elsewhere untouched); **structured layouts** (infographics, flowcharts, mixed text+image with legible small text). Up to ~2048x2048.
- **Avoid:** quality boosters ("masterpiece", "8K", "best quality") HARM output (they distract the CoT pipeline); no `(word:1.3)` weights; negatives NOT supported; no guidance-scale param.
- **Thinking toggle (ComfyUI v0.28.0):** the Seedream node gained a widget to **disable thinking** (Comfy-Org PR #14853). Leave it ON for the CoT behaviour this recipe assumes (relationship reasoning, layout planning); turn it OFF for a faster, more literal pass when the prompt is already explicit and you do not want the model re-planning the composition.
- **Build the graph (confirmed from the official templates):** ONE node **`ByteDanceSeedreamNodeV2`** -> **`SaveImageAdvanced`** (its `IMAGE` out -> `SaveImageAdvanced.images`). Node widgets = prompt, `model` = `seedream 5.0 pro`, a **size-preset combo** (e.g. `(1K) 1024x1024 (1:1)`) + width / height (up to 2048), seed + control_after_generate (leave the remaining toggles at their template defaults).
  - **t2i** - just the node, its `model.images.image_1` input left unconnected.
  - **edit / multi-image** - **`LoadImage`** -> `model.images.image_1` (add `image_2`, `image_3`... for more refs) -> node -> `SaveImageAdvanced`. To constrain the edit to a drawn region, route `LoadImage` through a **`Painter`** node first (draw marks; its `IMAGE` out feeds `image_1`) - the official edit template does exactly this.
  - Templates `api_bytedance_seedream_5_0_pro_{t2i,image_edit}.json`. API / paid (Comfy Cloud or a BytePlus key).

- **Strengths:** long multi-word text with exact positioning/sizing; `style` param (`realistic_image`, `digital_illustration`, `vector_illustration`, `icon`) + 100+ presets + custom style refs; true scalable vector/SVG.
- **Avoid:** negative phrasing confuses it (just omit unwanted elements, no negative field); ambiguous nouns; vague plurals.

### GPT-Image (gpt-image-2, OpenAI)
- **Prompt style:** structured natural-language ("structure beats length"), a labeled five-slot brief.

- **Strengths:** accurate dense/multi-font text, identity consistency, any size, up to 10 refs; `low` quality is production-grade.
- **Avoid:** vague praise, generic style tags, one giant rewrite, negative subject phrasing. No negative field, state avoidances in Constraints.
- **Settings (API):** `quality` (low/medium/high/auto), edges multiple of 16, max edge 3840px, <=3:1, reliable up to 2560x1440; `background`, `output_format`.

- **Strengths:** behavior-based light, concrete camera/lens, named aesthetics; `-quality` tier adds i2i (1-3 refs) and better non-English text.
- **Avoid:** negatives IGNORED (rephrase positive); keyword stacking; mixed styles; buried subject.
- **ComfyUI (partner node):** the Grok Image node exposes a `resolution` combo of **`1K` / `2K`** (confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_grok.py`), plus an `aspect_ratio` combo.

### Chroma
- **Prompt style:** natural-language.
- **Structure:** descriptive sentence(s): subject, style, lighting, palette.
- **Strengths:** Apache-2.0 open-weight 8.9B from FLUX.1-schnell; broad/less-censored aesthetic range; Chroma1-HD is the higher-quality variant.
- **Avoid:** no official prompt-recipe doc (maker says users figure settings out), treat numbers as examples. Negatives supported (card example: "low quality, ugly, unfinished, out of focus, deformed, blurry, flat colors").
- **Settings:** card example ~40 steps, CFG 3.0, bfloat16; ChromaPipeline; same optimizations as Flux.
- **ComfyUI setup:** put the checkpoint in `diffusion_models/` (NOT `checkpoints/`); needs a T5 XXL text encoder (`t5xxl_fp16.safetensors`) in `models/clip/` and the FLUX VAE (`ae.safetensors`) in `models/vae/` as separate downloads.

Worked card example: "A high-fashion close-up portrait of a blonde woman in clear sunglasses ... bold teal and red color split ... designed for viewing with anaglyph 3D glasses." Sister model `Chroma1-Flash` is the fast CFG-baked variant if throughput matters.

### Krea 1 (FLUX.1 Krea [dev])
- **Prompt style:** natural-language, no weighting syntax.
- **Structure:** subject + style + scene + lighting + colors; short imaginative prompts work.
- **Strengths:** photorealism without the "AI look" (no plastic texture / blurred-bg artifacts); drop-in for FLUX.1 [dev].
- **Avoid:** filler ("beautiful", "amazing"); ignores `(best quality:1.3)` / `[[masterpiece]]` brackets/colons; guidance-distilled so no true CFG/negative (like FLUX.1 [dev]).
- **Settings:** guidance_scale 4.5 (official example); 1024x1024; FLUX.1 [dev] pipeline.
- **Download / license:** GATED on HF, accept the license + use a token to download (must accept the FluxDev Non-Commercial License Agreement + Acceptable Use Policy on the model page first). License is NON-COMMERCIAL only (flux-1-dev-non-commercial-license).

### Krea 2 (Krea AI, open weights)
- **Prompt style:** natural language; long detailed prompts give the best results, but minimal prompts also work;
  put words in quotes for text rendering. Built-in prompt enhancement is on by default in the ComfyUI template (swap
  it for OpenAI / Gemini nodes, or use the repo's `expansion.txt` as an LLM system prompt).
- **Example (official prompt guide):** minimal works (`immense rocket launch exhaust as seen from extremely close
  up`), but detail wins. Stack natural-language clauses for subject, composition, lighting, color, texture, and
  medium, e.g. `stylized digital painting of a dark convertible on a winding coastal cliff road, high-angle
  perspective, blocky painterly brushstrokes, golden hour sunlight hitting rocky orange terrain and green
  vegetation, ... vibrant warm color palette, sharp graphic shadows`.
- **Style-suffix pattern (from ~15 of the 20 official Raw/Turbo gallery prompts):** append a comma-separated style
  tag at the END of the scene description to steer style: `<scene>, <style tag>`. Example tags from the cards:
  `halftone texture`, `thermal imaging style`, `impressionist painting, visible brushstrokes`, `black and white
  photography` (others in the galleries: low-poly 3D models, anime, vintage collage, dark fantasy concept art).
- **Two models that pair:** **RAW** (base, undistilled, diverse and malleable) is for fine-tuning and LoRA training;
  **Turbo** (8-step distilled) is for fast inference. Train LoRAs on RAW, then apply them on Turbo (compatible).
- **Strengths:** from-scratch MMDiT; the most aesthetic open-weight image model and the #1 text-to-image model from
  an independent lab (Artificial Analysis); 2K-native on Turbo, strong text rendering. Architecture rides the Qwen
  stack: a Qwen3-VL-4B text encoder + the Qwen-Image VAE.
- **Settings:** RAW = full sampler, 52 steps, CFG 3.5, up to 1K. Turbo = 8 steps, CFG 0.0 (disabled), mu 1.15 (the
  flow shift), 1K to 2K (2048x2048).
- **Run it (ComfyUI, day-0 native, no custom nodes):** official template `image_krea2_turbo_t2i` in the Comfy-Org
  template library. Comfy-Org repackaged the weights at `huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Krea-2`:
  `diffusion_models/krea2_turbo_fp8_scaled` (plus BF16 / NVFP4 variants), `text_encoders/qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled`,
  `vae/qwen_image_vae`. NINE official style LoRAs (`Comfy-Org/Krea-2/loras`), each with its trigger word at strength
  1.0 (put the trigger phrase in the prompt): `krea2_darkbrush` "monochrome ink wash style", `krea2_dotmatrix`
  "Monochrome stippling style", `krea2_kidsdrawing` "naive expressive sketch style", `krea2_neondrip` "Textured abstract
  style", `krea2_rainywindow` "rainy window style", `krea2_retroanime` "Purple retro anime style", `krea2_softwatercolor`
  "Art Deco watercolor style", `krea2_sunsetblur` "ethereal motion blur style", `krea2_vintagetarot` "vintage tarot style".
- **Community style LoRAs (fal, ~1503):** beyond the 9 official LoRAs, `ilkerzgi/fal-Krea-2-Style-LoRAs` indexes ~1503
  community style LoRAs for Krea 2 Turbo (Krea-2 Community License), each its own repo (e.g. `ilkerzgi/krea-2-airy-porcelain-blue-lora`).
  Put the style trigger at the END of the prompt, LoRA scale 1.0-1.25; run on fal `fal-ai/krea-2/turbo/lora` or download the individual LoRA.
- **Weak VAE, much better decode (RECOMMENDED, big quality jump):** Krea 2's stock Qwen-Image VAE is the weak link;
  swapping the decoder is a large, clearly visible jump (practitioner-confirmed, not subtle). Use **NVIDIA PiD** (Pixel
  Diffusion Decoder: latent-conditioned pixel-diffusion decode + super-res in one pass) via **`Merserk/ComfyUI-PiD`**
  (MIT, Comfy-Org/PixelDiT loading; prefer over `tsolful/ComfyUI-PiD`, which is thinner + license "other"). **Build it:**
  PiD needs the latent AND its sigma, so replace the stock `KSampler -> VAEDecode` tail with `PiD KSampler Capture` (a
  drop-in sampler, outputs `pid_latent` + `pid_sigma`) -> `PiD Decode` (latent + caption + sigma -> `IMAGE`), caption from
  `PiD Text Prompt`. Krea 2 rides the Qwen-Image VAE latent, so use PiD's Qwen-Image path at `model_precision=bf16` (fp8 is
  Flux-only); weights auto-download (`auto_download=true`) into `models/vae/nvidia_pid/`. Simpler alternative: swap the VAE
  node for the **WAN 2.1 VAE**. (PiD's official backbones are flux/flux2/sd3/zimage; Krea 2 is community-applied, works very
  well.) Sources: github.com/Merserk/ComfyUI-PiD ; github.com/nv-tlabs/PiD ; Reddit r/StableDiffusion 1ue8rns ; t.me/GreenNeuralRobots/12656.
- **Reference-image control (image+mask), buildable:** `ComfyUI-Krea2TextEncoder` (ethanfel, MIT) adds the
  **`TextEncodeKrea2`** node (category `model/conditioning/krea2`). **Wire it in place of the text encode:** inputs `clip`
  (the Krea2 CLIP) + `prompt` (multiline) + optional reference pairs `image1`/`mask1` (a fresh `image2`/`mask2` appears as
  you connect each) + `mask_padding` (0 = tight crop to the mask, ~0.1 = ~10% margin per side); output `CONDITIONING` -> the
  sampler's positive. It forces the Krea2 descriptor template and routes the reference image+mask through Krea 2's
  Qwen3-VL-4B vision path, fixing the core `TextEncodeQwenImageEdit` (whose VAE input does nothing, since Krea 2's DiT has no
  reference-latent slot, and which falls back to the plain Qwen template).
- **Removing model refusals (abliterated text encoder) - general technique, shown here on Krea 2:** Krea 2's text
  encoder is `Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct`, an instruction-tuned VLM, so it inherits the LLM's alignment and can quietly
  steer away from legit-but-flagged VFX asks (wounds / gore for horror, weapons, real people or brands, "disturbing"
  imagery). Swapping it for an **abliterated** build (`huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-abliterated`, ComfyUI
  repack `ahmed22xa/...-comfy`; abliteration ablates the refusal direction via activation steering) makes the
  encoder encode the prompt faithfully instead of refusing - drop it into the `CLIPLoader` (type `krea2`) in place
  of the stock `qwen3vl_4b`. Model-agnostic: any DiT on an LLM/VLM encoder (Krea 2, Qwen-Image) takes the same swap
  (general note in ADVANCED.md "Removing model refusals"). It changes the encoder's WILLINGNESS, not the model's
  capability, and still carries the base license's acceptable-use terms - keep it to content you are licensed to
  make. The complete community build (Soror L.L., "RED_KREA_2") stacks three parts, documented here IN FULL so the
  kit can reproduce it on request: (1) the abliterated TE above (via `CLIPLoader`); (2) an uncensored UNET -
  `redcraftKREA2RedMix_krea2Edition.safetensors`, a community NSFW merge / finetune of Krea 2, loaded through
  `UNETLoader`; (3) an optional custom **LoKr** adapter trained on Krea 2 (the shared `max_Krea2_LoKr.yaml` config -
  LoKr = low-rank Kronecker, a LoRA variant), driven with RES4LYF samplers (`ClownsharKSampler_Beta` /
  `SharkOptions_Beta`), Perturbed-Attention Guidance, SageAttention, and the official `Comfy-Org/Krea-2` style
  LoRAs. Parts 2-3 are community, un-benchmarked, NSFW-oriented, and bound by the base license's acceptable-use
  terms; the reusable general part is the abliterated encoder. **USAGE (kit policy): on-request reference, not a
  promoted feature - apply it when a task actually calls for it, do NOT proactively suggest it, and keep it out of
  the README / CHANGELOG / banner.** Source: huggingface.co/huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-abliterated ;

- **License:** the code is Apache-2.0; the WEIGHTS use the Krea 2 Community License: commercial use needs a separate
  Enterprise License (community use is non-commercial), with acceptable-use / content-filter obligations.
- **Model merging (ComfyUI core):** the **`ModelMergeKrea2`** node (a `ModelMergeBlocks` subclass in `comfy_extras/nodes_model_merging_model_specific.py`) merges two Krea 2 `MODEL`s with per-block ratio control - blend a Krea 2 base with a fine-tune (or another Krea 2 checkpoint) without leaving ComfyUI.
- **Instruction editing on Krea 2 (community, experimental) - Ostris edit method + a detail-enhancer LoRA:** Krea 2
  is TEXT-TO-IMAGE, not an edit model, but Ostris (creator of AI Toolkit) trained an edit method and shipped
  **`ostris/ComfyUI-Krea2-Ostris-Edit`** (2 nodes, no extra deps, category `ostris/krea2`): **Text Encode Krea 2
  Ostris Edit** (encodes the prompt + up to 3 reference images through Krea 2's Qwen3-VL encoder with `Picture N:`
  vision placeholders, and with a VAE also VAE-encodes each ref as a reference latent; images fit 384x384 for the
  encoder / 1MP for the latent) and **Krea 2 Ostris Edit Model Patch** (patches Krea 2 to CONSUME those reference
  latents - stock Krea 2 ignores them; refs appended to the image tokens, conditioned at timestep 0; a no-op when
  there are no refs, so safe to leave in). CONFIRMED from the example graph (`workflow/Krea2_Ostris_Edit.json`, 16
  nodes): UNET **`krea2_turbo`**, CLIP **`qwen3vl_4b_alb_bf16`** (an ABLITERATED, vision-capable Qwen3-VL-4B; `alb`
  inferred = abliterated, which also helps edit prompts land - the vision weights are what encode the refs), VAE **`qwen_image_vae`**;
  the input image runs through core **`FluxKontextImageScale`** and then feeds both the **Text Encode Krea 2 Ostris
  Edit** image input AND a **`FluxKontextMultiReferenceLatentMethod`** set to `index_timestep_zero`; the edit LoRA
  loads via `LoraLoaderModelOnly` into the **Model Patch**; sampler is Turbo (euler / simple, **10 steps, cfg 1,
  denoise 1**, 1024x1024); the prompt is an edit instruction (the example: "make this person a cyclops"). Edit
  LoRAs are trained with ai-toolkit (`krea2` arch, `model_kwargs.edit: true`). One published edit LoRA: **`reverentelusarca/krea2-detail-enhancer-edit-lora`**
  (`krea-detail-enhancer-exp.safetensors`, **krea2-community-license** = non-commercial) - a DETAIL enhancer,
  trigger **"enhance this image"** (full prompt: high-res, rich fine detail, sharpen textures, add microdetail +
  natural grain, preserve the original composition / lighting / style). HONEST (author's own caveats): highly
  experimental, NOT Flux.2 Klein / Qwen-Image-Edit precision - it alters the image, shifts lighting / color
  slightly, and can fault on horizontal aspect ratios. Needs a Krea 2 text encoder that INCLUDES the Qwen3-VL
  vision weights (the vision-less encoder cannot encode the reference images). **Best results (how to drive it):**
  load the detail-enhancer at strength ~1 and use the author's FULL prompt, trigger first - "enhance this image.
  Enhance this image to high resolution with rich fine details. Sharpen all textures and surfaces, add microdetails
  and natural grain. Increase clarity and definition across all elements while preserving the original composition,
  lighting, and atmosphere. Image can be illustration or real photo, keep the original input style." Feed a SQUARE
  or vertical input (~1MP; the encoder downscales refs to 384x384 and the ref latent to 1MP anyway) and AVOID
  horizontal aspect ratios (the author reports faults there). Because the method shifts lighting / color slightly,
  if you need fidelity, color / luminance-match the output back to the source (our OCIO `Grade Match`, or an
  `ImageColorMatch`) - a cheap fix for the drift. Keep it to the detail / enhance job it was trained for; for
  precise object or text edits reach for Flux.2 [Klein] or Qwen-Image-Edit (Krea 2 is a t2i model bent into
  editing, not a native edit model). The shipped example is the Turbo path (10 steps, cfg 1); RAW (52 steps, CFG
  3.5) MAY lift fidelity but is untested with these edit LoRAs (inferred - would need a real run to confirm).

- **Style reference from an image (Turbo, core nodes, NO custom node needed):** `krea2_style_reference.safetensors`
  is a LoRA by ostris that makes Krea 2 Turbo generate in the STYLE of a reference image. **No trigger word** (the
  card says so outright); it was trained for 1-2 reference images.
  **Read the card against the template here.** The HF card tells you to install `ComfyUI-Krea2-Ostris-Edit` to run
  it. The official Comfy-Org template `image_krea2_turbo_int8_image_style_reference` does it with CORE nodes only,
  so the custom node is no longer required for this LoRA (confirmed by reading the template's node list, 2026-07-25).
  Build it: `UNETLoader` (`krea2_turbo_int8_convrot.safetensors`) -> `LoraLoaderModelOnly`
  (`krea2_style_reference.safetensors`, strength 1.0) -> `ModelSamplingFlux` (1.15, 0.5, 1024, 1024) -> `CFGGuider`
  (cfg **1.0**) -> `SamplerCustomAdvanced`; `CLIPLoader` (`qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled.safetensors`, **type `krea2`**) plus
  the reference `LoadImage` -> **`TextEncodeQwenImageEditPlus`** (this is the node that carries the reference image
  into conditioning) -> `CFGGuider`; **`FluxKontextMultiReferenceLatentMethod`** set to **`index_timestep_zero`** on
  the conditioning; `KSamplerSelect` `euler` + `BasicScheduler` (`simple`, **8 steps**, denoise 1.0) + `RandomNoise`
  into `SamplerCustomAdvanced`; `VAELoader` (`qwen_image_vae.safetensors`) -> `VAEDecode` -> `SaveImage`. A
  `ResolutionSelector` drives the output size, and the template leaves the built-in `TextGenerate` prompt-expander
  switched OFF for this graph.
  Weights: `Comfy-Org/Krea-2` `loras/krea2_style_reference.safetensors` (confirmed present by listing the repo), or
  the author's `ostris/krea2_turbo_style_reference`. Licence flag: **krea-2-community-license** (same as the base
  Turbo weights). Worked example from the card's `widget:` gallery: `a white yeti with horns reading a book that is
  titled "Ostris + Krea2 Style Reference"`.

### LongCat-Image / LongCat-Image-Edit (Meituan)
- **Prompt style:** natural-language (T2I) / instruction (edit), bilingual; 6B.
- **Structure:** CRITICAL text rule - enclose literal target text in quotes ('...' / "..."); a character-level encoder handles quoted content, unquoted text renders poorly. Edit instructions are direct ("turn the cat into a dog").
- **Strengths:** multilingual text in images, photorealism, efficient (6B beats larger on several benchmarks).
- **Avoid:** forgetting quotes around target text. Negative prompt can be empty.
- **Settings (T2I):** guidance_scale 4.0, 50 steps, 768x1344 canonical resolution, `enable_cfg_renorm=True`, `enable_prompt_rewrite=True` (LLM prompt-refine flag, improves quality), bf16, ~17GB VRAM with CPU offload.

### JoyAI Image Edit (JD, open weights, Apache-2.0)
- **What it is:** an instruction edit model with NATIVE core support since the `comfy_extras/nodes_joyimage.py` extension landed. One node only, `TextEncodeJoyImageEdit`, which does the whole conditioning job: it tokenizes the prompt WITH the reference images attached and, when a VAE is connected, also appends their encoded latents as `reference_latents`. Runs fully local; Apache-2.0, so no gated or non-commercial flag.
- **Prompt style:** a plain imperative edit instruction, English, no template and no trigger word. The official template's worked example is exactly `Change the background to a glacial scene.` A second, EMPTY `TextEncodeJoyImageEdit` supplies the negative conditioning, so leave the negative blank unless you have a reason.
- **Build the graph (confirmed from `comfy_extras/nodes_joyimage.py` on master + the official template `image_joyai_image_edit`):**
  - `UNETLoader` (`joyai_image_edit_int8_convrot.safetensors`, weight_dtype `default`) -> **`CFGNorm`** -> `KSampler.model`. Note the position: `CFGNorm` patches the MODEL, it is NOT a conditioning node, and putting it on the positive branch is the easiest way to get this graph wrong.
  - `CLIPLoader` (`qwen3vl_8b_joyimage_edit_int8_convrot.safetensors`, **type `joyimage`**, device `default`) -> `clip` on BOTH `TextEncodeJoyImageEdit` nodes. The `joyimage` CLIP type is what the official template sets (confirmed from its widget values); that a wrong type is what breaks reference handling is inferred, but it is the first thing to check when the edit ignores the reference.
  - `VAELoader` (`wan_2.1_vae.safetensors`) -> `vae` on BOTH `TextEncodeJoyImageEdit` nodes AND -> `VAEDecode.vae`. JoyAI Image Edit uses the **Wan 2.1 VAE**, not a Qwen or FLUX one.
  - `LoadImage` -> `ImageScaleToTotalPixels` (`nearest-exact`, **1.0 megapixels**) -> the reference input of **both** encode nodes, and the same resized image -> `GetImageSize` -> `EmptySD3LatentImage` width / height, so the latent matches the normalized input instead of a fixed square. The official template feeds the positive AND the negative encoder the same image and vae; only the prompt differs.
  - positive `TextEncodeJoyImageEdit` -> `KSampler.positive`; the empty-prompt one -> `KSampler.negative`; `EmptySD3LatentImage` -> `KSampler.latent_image`; `KSampler` -> `VAEDecode` -> `SaveImageAdvanced`.
  - `images` is an **Autogrow** input, so the socket on the NODE is named **`images.image0`** (zero-based, namespaced), growing to at most six slots. Multi-reference edits are wired by adding slots, not by stacking nodes. Two different names for the same wire, do not confuse them: the official template wraps this in a subgraph whose OUTER port is called `image1`, and that port feeds `images.image0` on both encode nodes (confirmed by tracing the subgraph's boundary links). `vae` is optional: without it you get text-plus-image conditioning but no `reference_latents`, which is the weaker path.
- **Settings (from the official template):** 40 steps, CFG **4.0**, sampler `euler`, scheduler `normal`, denoise 1.0, latent 1024x1024 (driven by `GetImageSize`), `CFGNorm` strength 1.0 enabled.
- **Resolution buckets:** the node snaps every reference image to the nearest of 49 fixed ~1MP buckets by aspect ratio, from `512x2048` through `1024x1024` to `2048x512`. Feeding a wilder aspect than 1:4 / 4:1 means it gets letterboxed into the closest bucket. Each reference input must be a SINGLE image; a batch raises `JoyImage reference inputs must contain one image each`.
- **Weights:** `Comfy-Org/JoyAI-Image-Edit` hosts `diffusion_models/joyai_image_edit_{bf16,int8_convrot}.safetensors`, `text_encoders/qwen3vl_8b_joyimage_edit_{bf16,int8_convrot}.safetensors` and `vae/wan_2.1_vae.safetensors` (confirmed by listing the repo's files, 2026-07-25). **Broken card, work around it:** that repo's README body was copy-pasted from the multi-image *Plus* release and tells you to fetch `joyai_image_edit_plus_bf16` / `qwen3vl_8b_joyimage_edit_plus_*`, filenames the repo does not contain. Trust the file listing and the template, not the card. The separate Plus (multi-image) weights live at `jdopensource/JoyAI-Image-Edit-Plus-ComfyUI`.
- **Avoid:** the `_plus_` filenames from the card; putting `CFGNorm` on the conditioning instead of the model; a non-`joyimage` CLIP type; skipping the 1MP normalize step and feeding a 4K plate straight in; batching several images into one reference slot.

### Wan 2.1 & 2.2 (Alibaba)
- **Prompt style:** concise cinematic shot description; camera-sees-first, then action, then one camera move; specific descriptors. I2V = motion + camera only (image is the anchor).
- **Structure:** shot type -> subject -> primary action -> one camera move -> environment (3-5) -> lighting -> style -> color.
- **Strengths:** 2.2 better prompt adherence, negative enforcement, camera control, temporal consistency; sequential "first... then...".
- **Avoid:** multiple actions/conflicting camera moves, keyword stuffing, vague descriptors. Negatives ARE supported (best on 2.2): "blurry, low quality, watermark, jittery motion, deformed hands, extra limbs, distorted face, morphing".
- **Settings:** ~5s; native fps 16 (24 for 5B TI2V); ~480-720p by VRAM; prompt ~256 tokens; 14B loads BOTH high-noise + low-noise experts sequentially; 5B TI2V single hybrid (8GB-friendly). Use the official ComfyUI Wan2.2 workflow defaults; run a short low-res test first.
- **Multi-shot temporal control (Prompt Relay):** Wan 2.2 is the NATIVE target of Prompt Relay (arXiv 2604.10030):
  route timed `local_prompts` to their segments via a cross-attention penalty for multi-event clips without
  entanglement (often beats base Wan 2.2 on temporal alignment, near Kling 3.0). Official Wan2.2 implementation +
  ComfyUI port `kijai/ComfyUI-PromptRelay`; node + Smart-syntax details in the LTX-2.3 entry. Source: gordonchen19.github.io/Prompt-Relay.

---

### Wan 2.5 / 2.6 (Alibaba, API)
- **Prompt style:** cinematic visual first, then layer audio; multi-shot uses a global style line + timed blocks ("Shot 1 [0-3s]: ..."); I2V describes temporal change only.
- **Structure:** shot -> subject -> action -> one camera move -> environment -> lighting -> style -> `Audio: [dialogue / SFX / ambient / music]`; R2V tags `@Video1/@Video2/@Video3`.
- **Strengths:** synchronized multilingual lip-sync dialogue, ambient/SFX/music, multi-person timbre, multi-shot; make audio specific.
- **Avoid:** audio overpowering visual instruction; vague audio. Negatives supported (~500 chars); LLM prompt expansion on by default.
- **Settings:** API; 720p/1080p; 5/10/15s (R2V 5/10s); aspect 16:9/9:16/1:1/4:3/3:4; audio in WAV/MP3 3-30s. Use API-wrapper/partner nodes.

---

### Wan 2.7 (Alibaba)
- **Prompt style:** generation formula Subject + Scene + Motion + Aesthetic control (light, shot size, angle, lens, move) + Stylization + `Sound description`. Editing uses imperative commands instead.
- **Structure:** subject (appearance) -> scene -> motion (amplitude + speed) -> aesthetic control -> stylization -> audio; R2V uses numbered indices ("the character in Video 1"), NOT `@Video1`; FLF2V = first -> bridging motion -> end.
- **Strengths:** first+last-frame control, 3x3 image input for cross-shot consistency, up to 5 refs, subject+voice cloning, instruction edits, multi-shot.
- **Avoid:** multiple actions/camera moves per shot, mixing description with edit commands, `@VideoN` tags. Negatives supported.
- **Settings:** API (open Apache-2.0 weights expected Q2 2026); 720p/1080p; 2-15s; ~80-120 words; ComfyUI partner nodes v0.18.5+.

### LTX-2.3 (Lightricks)
- **Prompt style (official guide):** ONE flowing cinematography paragraph, not tag dumps. Order: shot/framing ->
  scene (lighting, color, texture, atmosphere) -> action (present-tense verbs) -> character (age, clothing,
  features) -> camera move(s) -> audio. Match prompt length to clip length (a 10-word prompt for a 10s clip
  underperforms; longer beats shorter). Dialogue in quotation marks, short phrases with acting beats between them;
  describe performance physically ("pauses, looks aside"), not emotionally ("sad"). Lens/optics terms land
  ("macro lens", "shallow depth of field", "golden hour", "handheld tracking").
- **I2V:** prompt the MOTION / transition only, do not re-describe what is already in the image. Audio-to-video:
  the audio anchors timing, the prompt describes the visual interpretation.
- **Strengths:** native synced audio (more impactful in 2.3), multilingual dialogue (9 langs), smooth I2V, 9:16.
- **Avoid:** internal emotions, readable text/logos (unreliable), chaotic physics, overloaded or self-contradicting
  scenes, numerical over-specification. Negatives: the official guide does not cover them, but templates expose a
  negative conditioning input (works on Dev/CFG>1; Distilled at CFG=1 ignores it).
- **Settings:** width/height divisible by 32; frame count 8k+1 (9, 17, ... 121, 193, 257); fps up to 50; up to
  ~10s; two-stage 2x upsample (official spatial x2/x1.5 + temporal x2 upscalers pair with the base); Dev ~30-40
  steps CFG ~3.0 STG ~1.0; Distilled (8-step, CFG 1) for speed.
- **Run it (ComfyUI):** base t2v/i2v/flf2v/ia2v run on NATIVE ComfyUI core (no extra nodes, just keep ComfyUI
  updated). The IC-LoRA / id-LoRA / lipdub / control workflows REQUIRE the `ComfyUI-LTXVideo` node pack (Manager:
  search "LTXVideo") and its `LTXICLoRALoaderModelOnly`; a generic LoRA loader silently will NOT apply IC-LoRA
  conditioning. Useful IC-LoRAs (into `models/loras`, run via the ic_lora workflow): **Ingredients** (official,
  cross-clip character/prop consistency; two-part prompt "Reference sheet: ... / Generated video: ...", strength
  ~1.4); **MotionDeblur** (oumoumad, community, KEY for RESTORATION: reduces/removes motion blur and reconstructs
  sharper frames; file `ltx-2.3-22b-ic-lora-motiondeblur.safetensors`). Pair MotionDeblur with the LTX-2.3 restore
  templates (restore_archival_footage, remove_watermark) and the SeedVR2/SUPIR upscalers for a restoration chain.
- **HDR IC-LoRA (SDR -> HDR video):** `Lightricks/LTX-2.3-22b-IC-LoRA-HDR` (files `ltx-2.3-22b-ic-lora-hdr-0.9.safetensors`
  + `ltx-2.3-22b-ic-lora-hdr-scene-emb.safetensors`; `license:other`, GATED on HF, so accept the license + use a token
  to download). Per the paper (arXiv 2604.11788, "HDR Video Generation via Latent Alignment with Logarithmic Encoding")
  a logarithmic encoding maps HDR into the model's latent so a light IC-LoRA adapts it without retraining the encoder.
  READY workflow ships in the pack: `ComfyUI-LTXVideo/example_workflows/2.3/LTX-2.3_ICLoRA_HDR_Distilled.json` (with the
  `hdr.py` node + an `hdr_input_video.mp4` example); needs a CURRENT ComfyUI-LTXVideo with BOTH required nodes,
  `LTXICLoRALoaderModelOnly` (loads the LoRA + extracts the downscale factor) AND `LTXAddVideoICLoRAGuide` (adds the small
  latent as a guide), both absent in older installs. Save to an HDR-capable format (EXR / 16-bit / HDR video), NOT 8-bit PNG.
  The single-IMAGE analog of this (same LumiVid paper) is **LumiPic** on Qwen-Image-Edit / Flux.2 Klein - see the Qwen-Image-Edit section. Source:
  huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2.3-22b-IC-LoRA-HDR ; hdr-lumivid.github.io ; github.com/Lightricks/ComfyUI-LTXVideo.
- **Water Simulation IC-LoRA (add water to a live shot):** `Lightricks/LTX-2.3-22b-IC-LoRA-Water-Simulation` (file
  `ltx-2.3-22b-ic-lora-water-simulation-0.9.safetensors`; gated LTX-2-community-license; v2v reference-conditioned).
  Adds rivers / surf / rain / waterfalls / floods / splashes / wet specularities to a "dry" reference clip while keeping
  identity, clothing, pose, camera framing and background geometry identical. Control = the dry video VAE-encoded (24 fps,
  no mask, whole-frame, downscale 1), conditioning on the first `F` frames where `(F-1) % 8 == 0` (e.g. 121 / 153 / 185,
  ~7.7s max). Prompt is dual-panel and MUST contain the trigger `ADD WATER`: "Reference shows <dry scene>. Edited shows the
  same scene with water added. ADD WATER <concrete water: type, motion, how it interacts with the subject>. Subject
  identity, clothing, framing and background are identical to the reference." Worked gallery examples (vary the subject +
  the ADD-WATER clause, keep the wrapper): brown rabbit on mossy rocks -> fast river with white foam over the rocks; hands
  drawing lines in dry sand -> clear shallow water filling the lines; goats on a dirt path -> shallow clear stream
  splashing around their hooves; a hand over dry sand -> calm rippling water, hand dipping and dripping; people and a cart
  in a narrow alley -> murky flood submerging the cart wheels and splashing legs; dogs on a dry pine-needle forest floor ->
  calm reflective flood, dogs in a shallow marsh. Run via a V2V IC-LoRA workflow from the
  `ComfyUI-LTXVideo` pack (`LTX-2.3_V2V_ICLoRA_Single_Stage_Distilled.json` + `LTXICLoRALoaderModelOnly`); no water-specific
  workflow ships yet. **Strength sweet spot 1.2** (1.0-1.05 natural / identity-safe; 1.1-1.5 hard surface replacement like
  ground -> sea; >= 1.5 maximizes drama but warps faces). **CRITICAL recipe:** render the distilled **stage-1 ONLY at native
  resolution** (1920x1088 / 1088x1920, 24 fps), CFG 1.0, 8 fixed sigmas, no negative - the two-stage path applies the
  reference only in stage 1, and the stage-2 upscaler drifts the subject's identity; lowering strength does NOT fix it
  (structural). Trained on real water, so other liquids (lava / slime / paint) generalize only loosely. **Higher res without the
  stage-2 identity drift (kit tip, inferred, not card-tested):** the drift comes from the LTX stage-2 upscaler
  re-diffusing the subject from the prompt, so render the identity-safe stage-1 at native, then upscale OUTSIDE the LTX
  two-stage with a NON-re-diffusing / identity-preserving upscaler (SeedVR2, a tile-GAN like 4x-UltraSharp, or SUPIR at
  low denoise). Resolution rises and the subject stays put. Source:

- **3D render to photoreal (3DREAL IC-LoRA):** `fal/LTX-2.3-3DREAL-LoRA`, trigger `3DREAL` (license:other, base LTX-Video).
  An in-context LoRA that turns a rough grey 3D viewport animation (Blender blockouts, game-engine viewports, CG / synthetic
  renders) into photoreal cinematic video, with the 3D render as the reference. Run on fal `fal-ai/ltx-2.3-quality/render-to-real`
  (LoRA built in), or load it as an LTX-2.3 V2V IC-LoRA. Built for CG / synthetic-data to photoreal and viewport-driven final renders.
  Source: huggingface.co/fal/LTX-2.3-3DREAL-LoRA.
- **Multi-shot / timeline direction (Prompt Relay + LTX Director 2.0):** several TIMED events in ONE clip without
  temporal entanglement (one paragraph for many events smears them). **Prompt Relay** (arXiv 2604.10030, S-Lab NTU)
  is a training-free, inference-time method: it routes each prompt to its time segment via a distance penalty in
  cross-attention. Input = a `global_prompt` (persistent character/scene) + ordered `local_prompts` + optional
  `segment_lengths` (latent-frame budget per prompt, summing to (frames-1)//4+1). ComfyUI port:
  `kijai/ComfyUI-PromptRelay` (nodes `PromptRelayEncodeTimeline` + a "Smart" encoder: one field, segments split by
  `|` or `Scene N:` headers, weights `[0-50]`/ranges, auto frame distribution); ready graph
  `prompt_relay_ltx23_test_02.json`; works on LTX 2.3 AND Wan 2.2; WIP, NO license file (use ok, do not
  redistribute). **LTX Director 2.0** (`WhatDreamsCost/WhatDreamsCost-ComfyUI`, GPL-3.0) wraps Prompt Relay into a
  full timeline-editor node for LTX 2.3: trim/split/combine, IC-LoRA track, keyframes, audio inpaint, Retake
  (regenerate a shot segment), save/load timeline; ready graph `LTX_Director_2_Workflow_Hotfix.json` (nodes
  `LTXDirector`/`LTXDirectorGuide` + 2-stage `LTXVLatentUpsampler` + audio). Both REQUIRE current
  `ComfyUI-LTXVideo` + `ComfyUI-KJNodes`, and Prompt Relay monkeypatches cross-attention (version-sensitive).

- **Field techniques (community, surfaced from production users; NOT in the official LTXVideo pack unless noted):**
  - **External-audio sync (official nodes, field wiring):** drive video from an external audio track (image + audio ->
    motion/lip-synced clip) with `LTXVAudioVAEEncode/Decode`, `LTXVConcatAVLatent` / `LTXVSeparateAVLatent`,
    `LTXVEmptyLatentAudio`, `LoadAudio`, `TrimAudioDuration` (all official ComfyUI-LTXVideo). Tip: run the source through
    `ComfyUI-MelBandRoFormer` (stem separation) first to feed clean vocals.
  - **Fit the 22B on a 24GB card: GGUF.** `GGUFLoaderKJ` (KJNodes) loads a GGUF-quantized LTX-2.3, shrinking the ~25GB
    fp8 transformer to fit one 24GB GPU (the exact wall this kit hit sizing a 22B run). VRAM win for a small quality cost.
  - **Speed / quality / long clips (KJNodes + CacheDiT):** `CacheDiT_LTX2_Optimizer` (Jasonzzt/ComfyUI-CacheDiT) caches
    diffusion steps to accelerate inference; `LTX2_NAG` (KJNodes) adds Normalized Attention Guidance as a quality/adherence
    lever; `LTXVChunkFeedForward` (KJNodes) chunks the feed-forward to cut memory on long clips; `LTXVAddGuideMulti`
    (KJNodes) drives multi-keyframe (first / middle / last and more) guided motion.
  - **Lipsync + storyboard + long audio: GAP LTX 2.3 Motion** (`github.com/GeekatplayStudio/LTX-2-3-LipSync`, MIT) adds
    nodes for audio-segment render loops, storyboard scheduling, and motion transfer for long-form audio-driven video.
    CAVEAT: users report the storyboard variant's custom-audio path can produce noise, so test the audio leg on a short
    clip first. Status: community-endorsed (widely used in production), NOT independently benchmarked by this kit.
  - **Text / footage to 360 VR video (equirectangular panorama):** LTX-2.3 renders a full 360 equirectangular
    video (2:1, look-around VR) with synced audio. Two community routes, NEITHER official Lightricks: (a) **text
    -> 360** via the public CivitAI LoRA **`360-degree panoramic shot - LTX-2.3`** by Ragamuffin20 / Aitrepreneur
    (`civitai.com/models/2327337`, version 2816797, 643 MB; direct file
    `civitai.com/api/download/models/2816797?fileId=2702793`; base LTXV 2.3; **License: LTXV2** - Lightricks' LTX-2
    license governs, so verify it for your use; the uploader's CivitAI flags separately allow image / rent / sell).
    Trigger phrase **"A 360-degree panoramic video"**, weight **0.6-1** (even ~0.2 can work), aspect **2:1**, over
    the base t2v graph, optionally stacked with the distilled speed LoRA. A ready graph
    `LTX-2.3_360vr_distilled_3stage.json` ships in the panorama-stickers repo; this CivitAI LoRA is the one the
    public Floyo template wraps (corrects my earlier "source unconfirmed" note). KNOWN ISSUE: early versions left a
    visible vertical SEAM where the sphere wraps - the author reports it FIXED (civitai.com/articles/25291), and
    panorama-stickers' Seam Prep node is the in-graph fallback. (b) **flat footage -> 360 outpaint** via
    `TheBurgstall/VR-360-Outpaint-LTX2.3-IC-LoRA` (public, `cc-by-nc-4.0`, **v0.1 proof-of-concept**, file
    `ltx-2.3-22b-ic-lora-360-equirect-poc-step3500.safetensors`): an IC-LoRA that takes a flat 2.39:1 clip + a
    masked equirect reference and fills the unknown regions into a plausible 360 sphere (ready graphs
    `Equirect-Outpaint.json` / `Burgstall-VR-Outpaint.json` in the repo); rough edges outside its sweet spot,
    noncommercial only. Preview either in-canvas with the **`panorama-stickers`** pack (nomadoor, MIT;
    model-agnostic 360 tool, its four nodes are in `NODE_LIBRARY/custom-author.md`); prompt a "seamless
    equirectangular 2:1 360 panorama", keep width/height divisible by 32. **True-VR finishing (both routes,
    optional):** the raw output is MONO 360 - it plays in any 360 / VR player as-is, but for real depth add
    stereoscopic 3D with **`SamSeenX/ComfyUI_SSStereoscope`** (mono equirect -> stereo VR; CAVEAT: it has an upload
    size limit, ~500 MB clips fail, so split or downstream-process long shots), then inject VR metadata so headsets
    auto-detect it with Google's free Spatial Media tool (`github.com/google/spatial-media`). Source:

- **Train a custom LTX-2 LoRA (own character / style / motion / control):** that is the official Lightricks trainer
  (`Lightricks/LTX-2`, `packages/ltx-trainer`) + their `train-model` Claude skill, NOT ComfyUI; the trained
  `.safetensors` LoRA loads back here via the ComfyUI-LTXVideo loader. Needs Linux + CUDA + >= 32 GB VRAM per GPU
  (a 24 GB or Windows box cannot run it). When a user works with LTX-2 and wants a recurring custom subject/style or
  cross-shot consistency a prompt or the Ingredients IC-LoRA does not give, mention they can train a LoRA and offer
  the setup (one offer, not a nag). Full guide + the offer trigger: `docs/LTX2_TRAINING.md`.

### LTX-2 Pro (Lightricks)
- **Prompt style:** single flowing paragraph (4-8 sentences), not tag lists (the model resists keyword dumps); a shot list a camera operator could execute.
- **Structure:** scene anchor (location/time/atmosphere) -> subject + action verb -> camera + lens (movement, focal length, aperture, framing) -> style/color science -> motion/time cue; start with the action.
- **Strengths:** physically plausible camera work, lens/aperture realism, multi-keyframe interpolation, beat-matched audio, camera presets.
- **Avoid:** tag/adjective lists, multiple actions/characters, contradictory shots. Negatives weak at CFG=1 (describe what you WANT).
- **Settings:** 24GB+ -> 720p24/4s/~20 steps; 8-16GB -> 540p24/4s/~20 steps; width/height divisible by 32; frame count divisible by 8 then +1; max prompt ~200 words.

### Hunyuan Video (Tencent)
- **Prompt style:** detailed English natural language (MLLM text encoder); include dynamic motion descriptors and explicit camera cues; built-in Prompt Rewrite (Normal vs Master mode).
- **Structure:** subject + appearance -> action/motion (speed/intensity) -> camera movement -> scene -> lighting/style.
- **Strengths:** motion quality and physical realism, instruction following, subject consistency across camera moves.
- **Avoid:** leans on positive description + Prompt Rewrite rather than negatives; FP8 the diffusion model if OOM.
- **Settings (ComfyUI native T2V):** 1280x720x129f, 24 fps; steps ~20-30; sampler euler (default); scheduler simple; CFG ~6.0; denoise 1.0; encoders clip_l + llava_llama3 (fp8_scaled); VAE hunyuan_video_vae; flow-shift 7.0 is the card's scheduler shift value when configuring advanced sampler nodes.
- **VRAM floor (card):** 720p (720x1280x129f) needs ~60GB GPU memory, 540p (544x960x129f) needs ~45GB; a single consumer 24GB GPU CANNOT run 720p even with FP8 (FP8 saves only ~10GB) - use 540p or multi-GPU xDiT.

- **Strengths:** motion/physics fidelity, explicit camera direction, native audio (2.6/V3/O3) with lip-sync + multi-character dialogue; up to 15s / 6 shots (O3); O1 unifies generate + edit.
- **Avoid:** open-ended motion (looping), pronouns/synonyms across shots, >2 emphasis. Negatives ARE supported (no negation words).
- **Settings:** 1080p; 5/10s (O1 3-10s; O3 up to 15s); aspect 16:9/9:16/1:1; `cfg_scale` 0-1 (def 0.5); Standard vs Pro; prompt ~2500 chars.

### Gemini Omni Flash (Google)
- **What it is (confirmed, Google DeepMind model card, published 2026-05-19):** an any-to-any generative video model - text-to-video, image-to-video, and conversational video *editing* - with **native audio out**. Inputs are text, images, audio, and video; output is high-resolution video with audio. Google's card claims real-world-physics simulation and faithful instruction following.
- **ComfyUI (confirmed from the official Comfy-Org/workflow_templates, read 2026-06-30):** official partner node **`GeminiVideoOmni`** with three shipped templates - `api_google_gemini_omni_flash_t2v` / `_i2v` / `_video_edit`. It is an API / cloud partner node - runs server-side through Comfy's API, needs a Comfy API key + credits, like Veo / Kling / Sora - and needs a current ComfyUI (the node landed after 0.25.1; if it is missing, update ComfyUI + the frontend / api-nodes package).
  - **Node I/O:** inputs `model.prompt` (STRING), `model.images.image_1..3` (IMAGE, up to 3 reference images, used by I2V), `model.videos.video_1..2` (VIDEO - a source clip plus an optional second for edits); outputs `VIDEO` and a `STRING` (response text). Widgets seen in the templates: `["Omni Flash", "", 1, 0.95, <seed>, "randomize"]` = model variant, an (empty) text field, a count, ~0.95 temperature/guidance, seed, seed-control (exact widget labels inferred - confirm via `get_node_info GeminiVideoOmni` once your build has it).
  - **Three graphs (buildable, from the official templates):** T2V = `GeminiVideoOmni(model.prompt)` -> `SaveVideo` (+ `PreviewAny` on the STRING). I2V = `LoadImage` x1-3 -> `GeminiVideoOmni(image_1..3, prompt)` -> `SaveVideo`. Video-edit = `LoadVideo` -> `GeminiVideoOmni(video_1 [+ optional video_2], prompt)` -> `SaveVideo`.
- **"Replaces Veo entirely" is overstated:** Google's own card lists Veo and Gemini Omni Flash as separate models, and the official templates still ship Veo (`api_veo2_i2v`, `api_veo3`). Treat Omni Flash as an addition, not a Veo removal.
- **Prompt style (inferred from the Gemini / Veo family plus the conversational-edit design; verify against Google Flow / the node once you run it):** natural language, subject -> action -> setting -> camera -> audio; for an edit, give a plain conversational instruction ("make it night, add rain on the window, keep the actor"). Audio renders with the visual, so name dialogue / SFX / ambience in the prompt.
- **Third-party alternative:** the community pack `github.com/Anil-matcha/gemini-omni-comfyui` reaches the same model via the **muapi.ai** API (its own nodes + a video saver, `gemini_omni_nodes.py`) if you prefer that route over Comfy's own API.

- **Strengths:** coherence/continuity, native dialogue + SFX synced to timing, technical lens/film-stock cues; Pro = higher fidelity.
- **Avoid:** abstract descriptors, >2-3 beats, multiple camera moves, past ~100 words. Exclusions structured at end.
- **Settings:** T2V + I2V (image = first frame, match resolution); max ~2000 chars; Storyboard/Loop are web-app only.

### Seedance 1.0 and 2.0 (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style:** structured, concise (2.0 under ~60 words + constraints); cinematic camera language is the core strength.
- **Structure:** Subject -> Action (one verb/shot + speed + endpoint) -> Camera (shot size, then one move + angle + lens) -> Style -> Constraints; multi-shot via cut words ("Cut to / Camera switching"); 2.0 refs `@Image1 as the main character`.
- **Strengths:** camera-language response (surround, aerial, zoom, pan, follow, handheld); multi-shot consistency; 2.0 native audio with phoneme-level lip-sync (8+ langs), camera-motion replication, beat-synced editing.
- **Avoid:** stacking motion verbs, vague mood as camera direction; on-screen text and fast hands glitch; set "not fixed camera" when moving. Constraints (3-5 bans) substitute for a negative field.
- **Settings:** 480/720/1080p, **2.0 now up to 4K** (smoother gradients, richer tones, detail that holds through motion and into post; the templates default to 720p, raise the resolution field for 4K), 24fps; 2-12s (1.0) / 4-15s or auto (2.0); 2.0 inputs up to 9 images / 3 videos / 3 audio (`model.reference_images.image_1..9`, `reference_videos.video_*`, `reference_audios.audio_*`).
- **2.0 official ComfyUI templates / modes:** T2V, reference-to-video (R2V), first-last-frame (FLF2V); R2V and FLF2V each also ship a `_real_human` variant tuned for realistic people (T2V does not); `api_seedance2_0_t2v.json` + `api_seedance2_0_{r2v,flf2v}(_real_human).json` (Comfy-Org/workflow_templates), plus community storyboard-to-video / character-swap / LLM-prompt-helper.

### Luma Ray 2 / Ray 3 (Dream Machine)
- **Prompt style:** keep camera OUT of the prompt (set via API "Concepts"); content-only.
- **Structure:** Main subject -> Action (direction + endpoint) -> details -> scene/atmosphere -> style -> quality reinforcer at end; pass camera as composable Concepts (20 moves, 14 angles).
- **Strengths:** photorealism, composable multi-motion camera, Loop + Video Extension (~60s); Ray 3 reasoning + 16-bit EXR HDR.
- **Avoid:** camera in the prompt text; multiple primary actions; negative phrasing. No negative field, no CFG, no seed, no native audio.
- **Settings:** 540/720/1080p; 5s or 9s; many aspects; Ray 2 Flash 3x faster; image inputs `frame0`/`frame1`.
- **ComfyUI:** Ray 3.x runs via `LumaRay32TextToVideoNode` (+ `LumaRay32ExtendVideoNode` to extend a clip, chained by the upstream `generation_id`); template `api_luma_ray3_3_t2v.json`.

### Runway Gen-4 / Gen-4.5
- **Prompt style:** complete natural-language sentences (not keyword lists); precise verbs; one action + one camera move per sentence with a speed modifier.
- **Structure:** Subject action -> Camera motion -> Visual context/style; for I2V don't re-describe the source; references control their domain (Character / Style / Environment, up to 3).
- **Strengths:** reference consistency across shots, clean cinematic motion; Gen-4.5 adds T2V + sequenced camera choreography + higher resolution.
- **Avoid:** "no X"/"avoid Y" NOT supported (may backfire); keyword lists; competing actions. No negatives, no CFG, no native audio.
- **Settings:** 720p (Gen-4 Turbo) / 720-1080p (Gen-4.5); 5/10s; 24fps; max prompt 1000 chars; Gen-4 Turbo is I2V-only.

- **Structure:** bracket at the point the move occurs; combine up to 3 moves - simultaneous `[Pan left,Pedestal up]` (no gap) or sequential `[Push in] then [Pan right]`.
- **Strengths:** physics/motion realism, facial expression, frame-accurate motion; Director-mode camera; keyframe control; multilingual.
- **Avoid:** vague words, natural-language camera descriptions (use brackets), space after `]`, over-long. Default Prompt Optimizer rewrites prompts (set `prompt_optimizer: false` for precise control). No standard negative field.
- **Settings:** T2V + I2V; Standard vs Fast; prompt 2-2000 chars (optimal ~100-300).

- **Strengths:** customizable camera movement/angle, follows camera + lighting words (V5.6), product multi-clip orbit.
- **Avoid:** generic prompts, visual overload, omitting style, excessive length. Negatives ARE supported (list artifacts/objects/styles to exclude).
- **Settings:** 5/8/10s; up to 1080p (720p for 10s); aspect 16:9/9:16/4:5; T2V + I2V + Effects. (Maker docs gated; verify exact knobs against PixVerse platform docs.)

- **Structure:** reference labels first -> action (sequential) -> camera (intentional moves); Q1 leans on keyframes.
- **Strengths:** multi-subject reference consistency (up to 7, one image each, `@a, @b...`); built-in push/pull, pan, tilt, zoom; motion-amplitude control; video extension.
- **Avoid:** thin official prompt doc; keep references high-res; fixed seed for repeatable motion. Negative support not documented.

- **Structure:** one motion per shot; exactly ONE camera type (zoom OR pan OR rotate OR tilt); "smooth" reduces jitter.
- **Strengths:** quick turnaround; Pikascenes (combine refs, `ingredients_mode`), Pikaframes (up to 5 keyframes) for transitions/loops.
- **Avoid:** complex multi-stage motion, stacking camera types, over-describing. Negatives ARE supported ("ugly, blurry, low quality, watermark, distorted, jittery, morphing"). Pikaffects/Pikaswaps are web-UI only.

### Sync 3 (sync.so) - lip sync + talking image
- **What it is:** a dedicated LIP-SYNC model, not a general video generator. Two jobs: re-sync the mouth of existing footage to new speech, or bring a single still portrait to life from an audio track. Handles close-ups, profiles and partial obstructions automatically while preserving the speaker's expression. Cost scales with output duration. API / paid (Comfy Cloud or a sync.so key).
- **Prompt style:** only the Talking Image node takes text, and it is OPTIONAL guidance for how the portrait comes to life (framing, mood, small motion), not a scene description. The audio drives everything else. Lip Sync takes no prompt at all.
- **Build the graph (confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_sync_so.py` + the official templates):**
  - **Lip sync existing footage** - `LoadVideo` -> **`SyncLipSyncNode`** ("sync.so Lip Sync") `video`, plus `LoadAudio` (or `RecordAudio`) -> its `audio`; `VIDEO` out -> `SaveVideo`. Template `api_sync_so_lip_sync_video`.
  - **Talking portrait** - `LoadImage` -> **`SyncTalkingImageNode`** ("sync.so Talking Image") `image`, plus `LoadAudio` -> its `audio`; `VIDEO` out -> `SaveVideo`. Template `api_sync_so_talking_image`. Output duration MATCHES the audio length.
- **Settings that matter:**
  - `model` = `sync-3` on both. The image input is **exclusive to sync-3**.
  - **`sync_mode`** (Lip Sync only): `bounce` (default) / `cut_off` / `loop` / `silence` / `remap` - how a duration mismatch between video and audio is resolved, and it also SETS the output length. This is the knob to reach for first when the result runs long or short.
  - Face location: `default` / `auto-detect` / `coordinates` (Lip Sync also has `auto-detect`). Pick `coordinates` and give the X / Y pixel position (plus, on Lip Sync, the video frame to locate from) when several faces are in shot and it syncs the wrong one.
  - Talking Image has an auto-downscale toggle (on by default) for images past 4K.
  - `seed` only controls whether the node re-runs; results are non-deterministic regardless of seed (the node's own tooltip says so).
- **Input limits:** video and image up to 4K (4096x2160); a CONSTANT frame rate of 24 / 25 / 30 fps works best for the source footage.
- **Avoid:** treating it as a text-to-video model (there is no scene generation); expecting seed-reproducible output; feeding variable-frame-rate footage.

### HeyGen (avatar video, talking photo, TTS, video translate)
- **What it is:** a PRESENTER / avatar stack, not a scene generator. Four jobs, one per node: drive a stock or custom avatar to speak (Avatar Video), animate any still photo of a person into a lip-synced clip (Talking Photo), synthesize speech alone (Text to Speech), or re-voice an existing spoken video into another language with the original speaker's cloned voice and re-animated mouth (Video Translate). API / paid (Comfy Cloud or a HeyGen key). Priced per second of output.
- **Prompt style:** there is NO scene prompt anywhere. The only free text is the SCRIPT the avatar speaks (or SSML, in the TTS node) and, on Create Avatar, a character DESCRIPTION. Do not write camera or lighting language; it is ignored.
- **Build the graph (confirmed from `comfy_api_nodes/nodes_heygen.py` on master + the four official templates):**
  - **Talking photo** - `LoadImage` -> **`HeyGenTalkingPhotoNode`** ("HeyGen Talking Photo") `image`; `VIDEO` out -> `SaveVideo`. Template `api_heygen_talking_photo`.
  - **Avatar presenter** - **`HeyGenAvatarVideoNode`** ("HeyGen Avatar Video") standalone; `VIDEO` out -> `SaveVideo`. To use your OWN avatar, chain **`HeyGenCreateAvatarNode`** ("HeyGen Create Avatar") first: its `avatar_id` (STRING) output -> the Avatar Video node's `custom_avatar_id`, and its `preview` (IMAGE) output -> `PreviewAny` / `SaveImage`. Template `api_heygen_avatar_video` also wires `SaveText` so the avatar_id is kept on disk, which matters because the ID is the only way to reuse that avatar later. Create Avatar is a FLAT $1.43 per call, so re-creating an avatar you failed to save is a real cost.
  - **Text to speech** - **`HeyGenTextToSpeechNode`** ("HeyGen Text to Speech", category `partner/audio/HeyGen`) standalone; `AUDIO` out -> `SaveAudioAdvanced`. Template `api_heygen_text_to_speech`.
  - **Video translate** - `LoadVideo` -> **`HeyGenVideoTranslateNode`** ("HeyGen Video Translate") `video`; `VIDEO` out -> `SaveVideo`. Template `api_heygen_video_translate`.
- **The `speech` widget is a DynamicCombo, and this is the part that trips people up.** On both Talking Photo and Avatar Video, `speech` ("speech source") switches the visible inputs: pick `script` and you get `text` (multiline, up to 5000 chars), `voice`, `custom_voice_id`, `voice_speed` (0.5-1.5); pick `audio` and you get a single `audio` AUDIO input (up to 10 minutes) and the voice widgets disappear. Feeding your own audio is how you use a voice HeyGen does not offer.
  - On Talking Photo a voice is REQUIRED in `script` mode (the node raises if none resolves). On Avatar Video it is optional, because the avatar carries a default voice; its `voice` list has an extra `(avatar's default voice)` option.
  - `custom_voice_id` overrides the `voice` combo when set. HeyGen's library is 2000+ voices, so the combos are only the curated popular subset.
- **`engine` on Avatar Video is also a DynamicCombo** and it filters the avatar list: `auto` shows every curated avatar and picks the best engine it supports (Avatar IV preferred), while `avatar_iv` / `avatar_iii` / `avatar_v` each show only the looks that support that engine. Fidelity and price go together: `avatar_iii` $0.0239-0.0619/s, `avatar_iv` $0.0715-0.0954/s, `avatar_v` $0.0954/s (flat). **Every price in this entry is read from the node's `price_badge` declaration in the schema, not from a billed run**, so treat them as what ComfyUI displays rather than as a confirmed invoice. Talking Photo is always Avatar IV at $0.0715/s. Choosing a `custom_avatar_id` whose look does not support the engine you forced raises an error naming the supported engines; `auto` avoids that.
- **Settings that matter:** `resolution` `720p` / `1080p` (default `1080p`) and `aspect_ratio` `auto` / `16:9` / `9:16` / `1:1` / `4:5` / `5:4` on both video nodes; `expressiveness` `low` / `medium` / `high` (default `low`) on Talking Photo only; `background_color` on Avatar Video takes a hex string and MUST start with `#` (`#00ff00` for a keyable green) or the node raises. Video Translate has `mode` `speed` (default, $0.0476/s) vs `precision` (better lip sync, $0.0954/s; the node's own tooltip calls it twice the price), `translate_audio_only` (swap the audio track and leave the original mouth alone), and `speaker_count` (0 = auto-detect, up to 10). TTS has `speed` 0.5-2.0 and an `ssml` boolean for pause / emphasis / pronunciation control.
- **Input limits:** images are downscaled automatically past 2000px on the long side (Talking Photo and the photo branch of Create Avatar); script text 1-5000 characters and the resulting speech must be at least 1 second; Create Avatar's prompt is up to 1000 characters with up to 3 optional reference images (`ref_image_1..3`).
- **Avoid:** expecting a scene or camera prompt to do anything; forgetting to save the `avatar_id`; setting a background colour without the leading `#`; assuming `seed` changes the result (the tooltip says outright it is not sent to HeyGen, it only forces a re-run).

- **Prompt style:** two fields. Tags = comma-separated genres/scenes/instruments/vocals/tempo ("electronic, pop, female voice, 110 bpm, melodic"). Lyrics = `[verse]`, `[chorus]`, `[bridge]`, `[outro]`; optional leading language code `[en]`/`[zh]` (19 languages).
- **Structure:** tags describe the sound; lyrics drive sung content and sections.
- **Strengths:** mainstream styles, lyric alignment, fast (~4 min audio in ~20s on A100), lyric editing/remix.
- **Avoid:** less-common languages underperform; lyric edits in small segments; copyright risk.
- **Settings:** duration in EmptyAceStepLatentAudio (-1 random); steps 27 or 60; `denoise` for similarity; vocal prominence via LatentOperationTonemapReinhard `multiplier`.

### ElevenLabs (API via ComfyUI nodes)
- **Prompt style:** TTS = plain text (voice/emotion via parameters). SFX = specific natural-language description (material, size, environment, distance, temporal arc, acoustic space); onomatopoeia helps.
- **Strengths:** natural multilingual voices, instant cloning, precise SFX; node supports `eleven_multilingual_v2` and `eleven_v3`.
- **Avoid:** over-long SFX prompts; expecting prompt words to control tone (use parameters).
- **Settings (built-in TTS node):** `stability` (def 0.5), `similarity_boost` (def 0.75), `style` (def 0.0), `speed` (def 1.0), `use_speaker_boost`. Text-to-Effect: `duration` 0.5-30s, `prompt_influence` 0-1 (def 0.3).

### ChatterBox (Resemble AI)
- **Prompt style:** literal text to speak (expressiveness via parameters, not words); voice cloning uses a 10s+ reference clip (match language to avoid accent transfer).
- **Strengths:** zero-shot cloning, emotion intensity dial, multilingual (23+ in V3), fast.
- **Avoid:** high `exaggeration` speeds up speech (lower `cfg_weight` to compensate); language mismatch causes accent bleed.
- **Settings:** defaults `exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`; dramatic `exaggeration` 0.7+ with `cfg_weight` ~0.3.
- **ComfyUI build:** the cited repo is the Python library; for ComfyUI install `filliptm/ComfyUI_Fill-ChatterBox` (ComfyUI Manager), whose TTS node takes `text` + `reference_audio` + `exaggeration` + `cfg_weight` -> AUDIO.

### Seed Audio 1.0 (ByteDance)
- **Prompt style (this is the whole game):** write the scene as a SCRIPT and wrap everything that is NOT spoken dialogue in `[square brackets]` - only text in quotes after `says / whispers / replies` gets voiced. Un-bracketed prose is read aloud as narration and bloats the clip. Order: `[Language: ...]` -> `[Environment: ...]` -> `[Background music / SFX: ...]` -> `Name (voice traits) says: "line"` -> `[beats / SFX / Outro]`. Describe each voice (gender, age, accent, emotion, tone, pace) inside the parentheses before `says`.
- **Lock the language:** English + Chinese only, and it mixes them if you don't pin it. Put `[Language: English only.]` (or `Chinese only.`) near the top AND write "speaks English only" into each character's voice traits.
- **Limits (confirmed from the templates):** prompt <=3000 chars, output <=2 min.
- **Strengths:** ONE pass gives a FULL audio scene - ambience + multi-character dialogue (per-voice traits) + background music + SFX - not plain TTS or a music-tag list. Three modes on the same node.
- **Build the graph (confirmed from the official templates):** node **`ByteDanceSeedAudio`** -> **`SaveAudioAdvanced`** (widgets `mp3` / `V0`). Node widgets = prompt, a **mode combo**, `sample_rate` `24000`, seed + control_after_generate (leave the middle toggles at their defaults).
  - **t2a** - mode `text only`, no inputs. (Also the clean way to make a reference clip for ta2a.)
  - **ta2a** - mode `audio reference`; **`LoadAudio`** -> `reference_mode.reference_audio_1` (add `_2`, `_3` in order, no gaps, <=30s each). In the prompt tag each speaker `voiced by @Audio1 / @Audio2 / @Audio3` matching the connected clip - every `@AudioN` used must have a clip, and a speaker reuses the same `@AudioN` on later lines. `@Audio1` = `reference_audio_1`, etc.
  - **ti2a** - mode `image reference`; **`LoadImage`** -> `reference_mode.reference_image`; the image derives ONE character voice, the prompt still drives language + scene. Do NOT use `@AudioN` in this mode.

### Hunyuan3D (Tencent)
- **Prompt style:** subject supplied mainly as a clean input image (single or multi-view, background removed); text is secondary.
- **Structure:** two stages - Hunyuan3D-DiT geometry, then Hunyuan3D-Paint textures/PBR; use `Hunyuan3Dv2Conditioning` (single) or `...MultiView`.
- **Strengths:** strong geometry from images, multi-view input, high-res PBR textures.
- **Avoid:** cluttered/un-preprocessed input images; native ComfyUI gives geometry only on `2mv`.
- **Settings:** output `.glb` to ComfyUI/output/mesh; turbo workflow CFG/Flux-Guidance ~1.0; VRAM Mini 5GB / Standard 6GB geometry / 12GB with texture.

### Tripo
- **Prompt style:** "Subject + Detail Description + Style Definition" ("A futuristic cybernetic helmet, matte black finish, glowing blue neon strips, high detail, sci-fi style"); concrete geometry/materials/finishes.
- **Structure:** main subject + features clearly; prioritize materials over lighting.
- **Strengths:** material/texture fidelity, multi-view fusion, smart retopology; texture on/off, face-limit budget.
- **Avoid:** abstract adjectives, over-long prompts, cluttered/off-center input images.
- **Settings:** texture on/off; `face_limit`; image input JPG/PNG/WEBP <5MB, solid background, centered.
- **ComfyUI node:** `VAST-AI-Research/ComfyUI-Tripo` (Comfy Registry: `comfyui-tripo`); key nodes `TripoAPIDraft` (text/image -> draft mesh), `TripoTextureModel`, `TripoRefineModel`; needs a Tripo API key.

- **Strengths:** geometry quality (Gen-2), quad meshes, HD/4K textures, PBR/Shaded/All material modes, broad export.
- **Avoid:** vague prompts; cluttered backgrounds / low-res inputs (>=512x512, <=16MB); download links expire ~10 min.

### Meshy
- **Prompt style:** Subject + Modifiers (materials, colors, details) + Style; 3-6 concrete physical details; reference anchors; style keywords (low-poly, photorealistic, cartoon, cyberpunk neon, anime cell shading).
- **Structure:** one object, not a scene; add "T-Pose" to characters you plan to rig.
- **Strengths:** style range, character/rigging support, iterative refine; prompts up to 800 chars, any language.
- **Avoid:** describing whole scenes; evaluative adjectives. Negatives ARE supported (`negative_prompt`). Iterate (Generate -> Refine -> Adjust).

### Image
**Capybara** (unified image + video, gen + edit), Glanty / xgen-universe, built on HunyuanVideo-1.5. The card defines
exactly four `--task_type` values: t2i, t2v, ti2i (instruction image edit), tv2v (instruction video edit); there is no
I2V task. Natural language for generation, imperative instruction for edits ("Change the time to night"); optional
Qwen3-VL-8B auto-rewrite expands short prompts (separate Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct download). Image 720p / 50 steps,
video 480p / 50 steps (frames 81/101/121). guidance_scale default is 1.0 (the card's parameter-table default); the 4.0
seen in the T2V/T2I example commands is a per-command override, not the default. FP8 available but requires NVIDIA
compute capability >= 8.9 (Ada Lovelace / Hopper: RTX 4090 / L40 / H100), so an RTX 3090 (cc 8.6) cannot use FP8.
Negatives not documented. Source: huggingface.co/xgen-universe/Capybara. **ComfyUI build:** official templates `Image_capybara_v0_1_image_edit.json` and `Image_capybara_v0_1_text_to_image.json` (Comfy-Org template library).

**Bernini-R** (image/video relighting edit), ByteDance, Wan2.2-based (also a 1.3B Wan2.1 fine-tune ~2.6GB). No official
prompt guide; prompt like a Wan/Qwen-edit relight: describe target lighting (direction, temperature, intensity, mood)
+ what to preserve ("keep subject and pose; relight as warm sunset key from camera-left"); use a reference image to
carry lighting across a set. Treat steps/CFG like a Wan2.2 edit workflow. Quantized variants for VRAM-constrained
setups (in the repo beyond the fp16 high/low-noise files): `wan2.2_bernini_r_high_noise_fp8_scaled.safetensors`,
`wan2.2_bernini_r_high_noise_mxfp8.safetensors`, `wan2.2_bernini_r_low_noise_fp8_scaled.safetensors`,
`wan2.2_bernini_r_low_noise_mxfp8.safetensors`. Source: huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Bernini-R. **ComfyUI build:** official tutorial docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/bytedance/bernini-r; the Comfy-Org repack runs on the standard Wan2.2 graph (the high-noise / low-noise UNETLoader pair).

**Anima** (anime t2i), CircleStone Labs, 2B (Qwen-3 0.6B encoder). Danbooru tags, natural language, or mix; order
`[quality/meta/year/safety] [char count] [character] [series] [artist] [general]`; positive prefix `masterpiece,
best quality, score_7, safe,`, negative `worst quality, low quality, score_1..3, artist name`; lowercase tags with
spaces, artists prefixed `@`. 512-1536px, 30-50 steps, CFG 4-5, sampler er_sde / euler_a / dpmpp_2m_sde_gpu;
negatives supported; weak at realism and text. Source: docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/anima/anima.

**Anima ControlNet-LLLite** (control + inpainting for the Anima base model above). ControlNet-LLLite by kohya-ss,
repacked by Comfy-Org; it loads as a **MODEL_PATCH**, not as a ControlNet, so none of the `ControlNetApply` nodes are
involved. **Licence flag: circlestone-labs NON-COMMERCIAL** (inherited from the Anima base model).
- **Build the graph (confirmed from `comfy_extras/nodes_model_patch.py` on master + the three official templates
  `image_anima_lllite_{any_control_to_image,depth_control_to_image,image_inpainting}`):** take the normal Anima
  text-to-image graph (`UNETLoader` `anima-base-v1.0.safetensors` + `CLIPLoader` `qwen_3_06b_base.safetensors` type
  `stable_diffusion` + `VAELoader` `qwen_image_vae.safetensors`) and insert ONE node on the MODEL line:
  **`ModelPatchLoader`** (category `model/loaders`, reads `ComfyUI/models/model_patches/`) -> `MODEL_PATCH` ->
  **`AnimaLLLiteApply`** ("Apply Anima LLLite", category `model_patches/anima`, EXPERIMENTAL). `AnimaLLLiteApply`
  takes `model` (MODEL), `model_patch` (MODEL_PATCH), `image` (IMAGE, the control map), optional `mask` (MASK), and
  returns a patched `MODEL` that goes on to the sampler. The control image is the node's own input, so there is no
  conditioning-side hookup at all.
- **Its three knobs:** `strength` (default 1.0, range -10..10), `start_percent` (0.0) and `end_percent` (1.0), the
  usual "hold the control over this slice of the schedule" pair, converted internally to sigmas.
- **Which patch file for which control** (all in `Comfy-Org/Anima-LLLite` under `model_patches/`, confirmed by
  listing the repo 2026-07-25): `anima-lllite-any-test-like-v2.safetensors` (generic "any" control, what the
  any-control template ships), `anima-lllite-depth-1`, `anima-lllite-lineart-1`, `anima-lllite-pose-1`,
  `anima-lllite-scribble-1`, `anima-lllite-inpainting-v2` (plus older `-v1` / `-step1000` / `-step2000` /
  `-v2-beta-epoch-03` variants). The lineart, pose and scribble patches have NO template of their own; they drop into
  the same any-control graph with the matching preprocessor.
- **Inpainting is the same node, driven by the mask.** The loader detects a 4-channel-conditioning patch and only
  then is `mask` used; with a 4-channel patch and no mask connected the node silently substitutes an all-zero mask
  (confirmed in the code; that this means "edits nothing" is inferred, not run), and with a 3-channel control patch
  any mask you connect is set to `None` and DISCARDED (confirmed). So a mask that appears to do
  nothing means you loaded the wrong patch file. Template `image_anima_lllite_image_inpainting` draws the mask with
  the `Painter` node and warns to resize inputs past 1024x1024.
- **Feeding the control map:** the any-control template uses `Canny` and notes you can swap in any other
  preprocessor (Node Library -> Comfy Blueprints -> Conditioning & Preprocessors). The depth template builds its map
  with **Depth Anything 3**: `LoadDA3Model` (`depth_anything_3_mono_large.safetensors`, in `models/geometry_estimation/`)
  -> `DA3Inference` (`resolution` 504, `upper_bound_resize`, `mode` `mono`) -> `DA3Render` (`output` `depth`,
  `v2_style`, colored off) -> IMAGE into `AnimaLLLiteApply.image`. Normalize the source first with
  `ResizeImageMaskNode` (`scale total pixels`, 1 MP, `lanczos`).
- **Settings (from all three templates):** 1024x1024, 30 steps, CFG 4.0, sampler `euler`, scheduler `simple`,
  `AnimaLLLiteApply` at strength 1.0 / 0.0 / 1.0, plus `anima-turbo-lora-v0.2.safetensors` on a
  `LoraLoaderModelOnly` at 1.0. Negative stays the standard Anima one (`worst quality, low quality, score_1,
  score_2, score_3, blurry, jpeg artifacts, sepia`).
- **Avoid:** reaching for `ControlNetApply` (wrong node class entirely); putting the patch in `models/controlnet/`
  instead of `models/model_patches/`; expecting the mask to work on a non-inpainting patch.
- **Source:** `comfy_extras/nodes_model_patch.py` (`ModelPatchLoader` detection key `lllite_conditioning1.conv1.weight`,
  `AnimaLLLiteApply` schema) ; `comfy_extras/nodes_depth_anything_3.py` ; huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Anima-LLLite ;
  original huggingface.co/kohya-ss/Anima-LLLite.

**NewBie (Exp0.1)** (anime t2i), 3.5B Next-DiT (Gemma3-4B + Jina-CLIP-v2, FLUX VAE). Danbooru tags or natural
language, but trained on XML structured prompts that bind attributes per character. Use per-character XML blocks
(`<character_1><gender>1girl</gender><appearance>...</appearance><clothing>...</clothing><action>...</action>
<position>center_left</position></character_1>`) + a `<general_tags>` block for multi-character scenes; flat tags fine
for single subjects. 1024x1024, ~28 steps. Source: docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/newbie-image/newbie-image-exp-0-1.

**PixelDiT** (t2i), NVIDIA, VAE-free pixel-space DiT (~1.3B, Gemma-2-2B-IT encoder). Plain natural-language positive +
negative (both exposed), no special syntax. No VAE means no reconstruction artifacts, fine texture preserved; 1024px
multi-aspect; steps/CFG not documented. Source: docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/pixeldit/pixeldit.

**Ovis-Image** (t2i, text rendering), Alibaba AIDC-AI, 7B optimized for legible text. Natural language, put literal
text in quotes inside the description (`[scene/style] + "EXACT TEXT" + [typography/material/lighting]`); best for
posters/banners/logos/UI. 1024px, 50 steps, CFG 5.0; negatives supported. Source: docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/ovis/ovis-image.

**Lens / Lens Turbo** (t2i), Microsoft, 3.8B MMDiT (GPT-OSS-20B encoder, FLUX.2 VAE); Turbo is the few-step distill.
Clear descriptive natural-language sentences (FLUX/MMDiT conventions); the encoder favors prompt following over tags.
1024px multi-aspect; Lens ~50 steps, Lens Turbo ~4-8 steps; CFG/negatives not documented; encoder can sit on CPU to
fit 24GB. Source: docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/lens/lens.

**Quiver** (text/image to SVG), API partner node (SVG.io Arrow 1.1 / Max). Natural-language description in `prompt` +
style hints in `instructions` ("minimalist unicorn icon for a SaaS dashboard" / "flat monochrome, rounded corners,
clean geometry"); optional references (up to 4 / 16 on Max) + viewBox attributes. Lower temperature (~0.4) for clean
geometry; output is real editable vector paths. Source: docs.quiver.ai ; blog.comfy.org/p/quiver-structured-svg-generation.

### Video
**HappyHorse 1.1**, Alibaba, cinematic video model with native synchronized audio, API (muapi.ai / Model Studio
partner nodes; ComfyUI nodes `HappyHorseTextToVideoApi` / `HappyHorseImageToVideoApi` / `HappyHorseReferenceVideoApi`):
T2V, I2V, reference-to-video (up to 9 reference images, no cross-contamination; the official ComfyUI template wires 3, image1-3); 3-15s at 720p/1080p, aspect
16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1 / 4:3 / 3:4 / 21:9. **Audio generates in the same render pass** (dialogue, sound effects and
background music synced to the video, no stitching in post). Long-context prompts (2,500+ chars, 6-8 consecutive
scenes in one prompt) and full cinematic language (shot-reverse-shot, tracking shots, transitions); natural skin
holds up for close-up commercial work. Prompt formula still `subject + environment + camera move + motion behavior +
lighting + style`; keep each motion small and specific ("subtle wind in hair", not "dancing in a chaotic crowd"),
ONE camera move per beat (slow pan / dolly-in / handheld push-in). Worked example: "young woman in red jacket on
rainy neon street, medium shot, slow handheld push-in, slight head turn and blinking, wet pavement reflections,
cinematic lighting, consistent face, stable background." R2V: feed identity/outfit/style refs into the
`model.reference_images.image1..9` slots to lock them across cuts (more refs = more consistency). Negatives not
documented (hosted API); settings are API fields (resolution, duration, aspect, audio), no sampler knobs. Official
templates: `api_happyhorse1_1_t2v.json` / `_i2v.json` / `_r2v.json` (Comfy-Org/workflow_templates).
Source: blog.comfy.org/p/happyhorse-11-is-now-available-in ; docs.comfy.org/tutorials/partner-nodes/happyhorse.

**HuMo**, ByteDance + Tsinghua, human-centric video (HuMo-1.7B in ComfyUI): lip-synced video from text + image +
audio. Text describes appearance/action/scene, image conditions identity, audio drives lip-sync; modes Text+Audio and Text+Image+Audio (TIA = most control, best
lip-sync; standalone Text+Image is marked not-implemented for 1.7B in the repo Todo). Up to 97 frames @ 25fps, 720p (~3.9s); TIA wants
>=24GB; negatives not documented. Source: github.com/Phantom-video/HuMo. **ComfyUI build:** HuMo-1.7B runs natively and lip-sync is built into TIA mode; `ckinpdx/comfyui-humo-audio-motion` adds the `HuMoAudioAttentionControlV4` node (audio cross-attention patch; inputs `model` + `audio_blocks`) as an optional experimental audio-driven body-motion enhancement, not the lip-sync itself.

**SCAIL-2**, zai-org (Zhipu/GLM), Wan-based end-to-end character animation: animates a reference character with a
driving video (also replacement, multi-character). Control by inputs, not text: 1 reference image
+ 1 driving video + a per-frame driving mask (generated by the bundled SCAIL-Pose preprocessor; the mask is a required input even in Animation Mode); tune `pose_strength` (exact-copy vs style adaptation).
Source: github.com/zai-org/SCAIL-2. **ComfyUI build:** community all-in-one node `collbroGTR/comfyui-scail2-infinity` (also `TTPlanetPig/comfyui_scail2_multi_cond`); open its example workflow and feed the reference image + driving video + `pose_strength`.

### Audio
**Sonilo**, AI music, ComfyUI partner node: primarily video-to-music (scores a video frame-synced), plus a
text-to-music path. Video-to-music is promptless (analyzes visuals/pacing/emotion); optional brief mood+genre+
instrument phrase refines ("Dreamy ambient electronic", "Lazy jazz instrumental"); output auto-matches the video's
duration, ~20s, multiple variations. Not a lyric/structure tool. Source: docs.comfy.org/tutorials/partner-nodes/sonilo/video-to-music.

## Enhancement and utility (NOT prompt-driven)

These are not text-prompted generators. They take an existing image/video, or run inside a graph, and improve or
analyze it. They need the right SETTINGS and inputs, not a prompt recipe. Use them as pipeline steps (e.g. a final
upscale on a hero, frame interpolation on a clip, a depth map to drive ControlNet).

### Upscale, restore, interpolation
- **Real-ESRGAN / ESRGAN family** (upscale): GAN super-resolution, deterministic and fast; one pass that enlarges
  (2x/4x) and removes compression/blur. Use for a final 2x/4x on a good image or per-frame on video (detail
  preserved, not hallucinated). ComfyUI: `UpscaleModelLoader` -> `ImageUpscaleWithModel`; scale is baked into the
  model file (RealESRGAN_x2/x4plus, 4x-UltraSharp = 4x); add an ImageScale downsample for non-native targets.
  Source: github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN, OpenModelDB.
- **SUPIR** (diffusion restore/upscale): SDXL-based, regenerates plausible high-frequency detail, optional caption.
  Use on heavily degraded/low-res photos where ESRGAN stays soft; heavier/slower, a quality pass not a bulk step.
  Settings: scale_by, ~30-45 steps, cfg, denoise, s_churn/s_noise; v0Q (quality) vs v0F (light degradation,
  faithful); ~10GB (512->1024) to 24GB (~3072px), FP8 + VAE tiling cuts VRAM. LICENSE: the SUPIR weights are
  NON-COMMERCIAL (XPixel Group); do not use in a commercial pipeline. Source: github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-SUPIR.
- **SeedVR2** (video/image upscale+restore): one-step diffusion with temporal consistency (frames denoised
  together). Target the short edge (default 1080); 3B (fast) vs 7B (quality); FP16/FP8/GGUF; batch follows the
  4n+1 rule (1,5,9,13,17,21...); ~8GB to 24GB+. Source: github.com/numz/ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler.
- **FlashVSR** (video super-res): one-step streaming diffusion, ~17 FPS at 768x1408 on an A100; designed for 4x SR
  (use 4x for best stability); V1.1 recommended. CAVEAT: needs the Block-Sparse Attention (LCSA) module
  (`mit-han-lab/Block-Sparse-Attention`, a compile-and-install dependency, memory-intensive at build time); without it
  ComfyUI and other third-party implementations fall back to DENSE attention with noticeable quality degradation at
  higher resolutions (the card calls out early ComfyUI versions as affected). GPU compatibility confirmed on A100/A800;
  H200 (Hopper) also runs per the card (limited acceleration); RTX 40/50 and H800 currently unknown. Source: huggingface.co/JunhaoZhuang/FlashVSR. **ComfyUI build:** runs through kijai `ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper` (FlashVSR is a supported family there) - see KIJAI.md for the WanVideoWrapper loader / sampler nodes. (`OHLIA/flashvsr_mix_gui` is a standalone GUI, not a node pack.)
- **Z-Image-Turbo Fun-ControlNet-Tile** (diffusion tile SR): ControlNet-Tile super-res for the Z-Image-Turbo stack,
  trained to 2048x2048, 8-step distilled; tiled so structure holds while enlarging. Reuses the Z-Image loader
  (8 steps, low CFG), so no separate SR model stack. This is the IDENTITY-FAITHFUL path: unlike the Union
  controlnet-locked img2img refine (which regenerates a real subject's face at denoise 0.4+), the Tile model
  enlarges without reinterpreting. See the Z-Image-Turbo entry above. Source:
  huggingface.co/alibaba-pai/Z-Image-Turbo-Fun-Controlnet-Union-2.1.
- **Topaz** (external API): commercial upscale/denoise/sharpen + frame interpolation via Topaz's API (built-in
  `TopazVideoEnhance` node). Upscale models Starlight (Astra) Fast/Creative + Starlight Precise 2.5; interpolation 15-240 fps, slow-mo 1-16x; needs a license.
  Source: docs.comfy.org/built-in-nodes/TopazVideoEnhance.
- **Magnific** (external API): cloud creative upscaler/enhancer (Freepik) up to 16K with prompt + creativity
  controls; no first-party ComfyUI node (HTTP/SDK or community wrapper). Scale 2x/4x/8x/16x. Source: docs.magnific.com.
- **FILM** (frame interpolation): Google, handles large motion; accepts as few as 2 frames, arbitrary multipliers.
  Use for slow-mo / fps boost with large motion. ComfyUI: FILM VFI node (multiplier, clear_cache_after_n_frames).
  Source: github.com/google-research/frame-interpolation.
- **RIFE** (frame interpolation): fast optical-flow interpolation, the default speed-first choice (e.g. 16->32/60
  fps over many frames). ComfyUI: RIFE VFI node (ckpt rife47/rife49, multiplier, ensemble). Source: github.com/hzwer/Practical-RIFE.

**Picking an upscaler + ordering a restore chain** (general practice, not tool-specific). Choose by content, not
only by scale: a GAN (Real-ESRGAN) is fast and faithful for photoreal footage, but x4 can look plastic on skin and
fine fabric, so x2 is the safer pore-preserving pass; a diffusion upscaler (FlashVSR / SeedVR2 / SUPIR) handles
stylized, anime, line-art, and AI-generated frames better and regenerates detail instead of only sharpening. Rough
rule: source under ~540p or big jumps -> 4x GAN; 720p+ cleanup -> 2x GAN; animated / AI-gen -> diffusion. ORDER
matters in a restore chain: denoise FIRST (4x grain becomes 4x larger grain, and noise turns into per-frame
flicker), then deinterlace (QTGMC / yadif) and deblock if the source is heavily compressed, THEN upscale, and
color-grade AFTER (more headroom). Stabilize on the original, not at 4x. Do not run x2 twice to fake x4 (it stacks
artifacts), and do not expect an upscaler to deblur, it reconstructs detail, not motion. Cheap generation path:
make it small, then upscale the keeper (e.g. LTX-2.3 at 512 -> Real-ESRGAN x4 -> ~2048).

### Segmentation, depth, pose, conditioning
- **SAM3** (segmentation): detects/segments/tracks every instance matching a text noun phrase or visual prompt,
  across images and video. Use to isolate subjects -> mask for inpaint/background-swap/compositing, or track an
  object through a clip. Outputs masks, boxes, scores, per-object IDs. Source: github.com/facebookresearch/sam3.
- **BiRefNet** (matting): high-res foreground mask with hair-level edges. Use for clean cutouts/background
  replacement when you need sharper edges than a coarse segmenter. Variants general/portrait/matting/HR (up to
  2048x2048). Source: github.com/ZhengPeng7/BiRefNet.
- **High-detail matting (hair / fur / semi-transparent / motion blur)** is a multi-stage VFX task, not one node:
  coarse select (SAM3 / BiRefNet) -> trimap -> alpha matte (ViTMatte / SDMatte / Matte-Anything) -> edge refine
  (LayerStyle `MaskEdgeUltraDetailV2`); for video use a temporal model (MatAnyone2, needs a SAM2/SAM3/SeC keyframe
  mask; or RVM for clean humans). Full recipe, tool table, ready-template pointer, and license flags in
  [`ADVANCED.md`](../../docs/ADVANCED.md).
- **Depth Anything V2 / V3** (depth/geometry): per-pixel relative depth from one image (V2); V3 adds consistent
  depth + geometry + camera pose across multi-view/video and can export point clouds. Use to make a depth map to
  drive a depth ControlNet, parallax, or masking. Source: github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2 ;
  github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Depth-Anything-3.
- **DWPose** (pose): whole-body 2D keypoints (18 body, 21/hand, 68 face) as a skeleton; a more accurate OpenPose
  replacement to drive a pose ControlNet. Source: github.com/IDEA-Research/DWPose.
- **MoGe** (geometry): monocular point map + depth + normals in one pass from a single photo, for 3D-aware
  conditioning/reconstruction beyond a flat depth map. MoGe-2 adds metric scale. Source: github.com/microsoft/MoGe.
- **IP-Adapter** (conditioning): ~22M adapter that lets a diffusion model take an IMAGE as a prompt (decoupled
  cross-attention). Use to transfer style/subject/face from a reference without text; stack with ControlNet.
  Variants base / Plus / Face / FaceID; main knob is conditioning weight. Source: github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter.
- **LivePortrait** (portrait animation): drives a still portrait with a driving video's motion/expression (stitching
  + eye/lip retargeting). Use to animate one portrait without per-subject training. Source: github.com/KlingAIResearch/LivePortrait.
- **Mediapipe** (landmarks): fast on-device face (478) / hand (21) / pose (33) landmarks (Holistic combines all).
  Use for lightweight keypoints for conditioning/masking/alignment. Source: ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe.
- **VOID** (video inpainting / object removal): Netflix open-source; removes a subject plus its shadows, reflections,
  and the motion it caused. Control is a 4-value greyscale "quadmask" (remove / overlap / physically-affected / keep),
  NOT a binary mask or text prompt. Two passes: Pass 1 base, Pass 2 optical-flow refinement for longer/textured clips.
  Source: docs.comfy.org/tutorials/utility/void-video-inpainting. **ComfyUI build:** the linked tutorial IS the official Comfy-Org template - open it for the quadmask input node and the two-pass (generate + optical-flow refine) graph.
- **Qwen3-VL TextGenerate** (in-graph local VLM, NOT an image/video model): a `TextGenerate` node fed by `CLIPLoader(qwen3vl_4b_fp8_scaled.safetensors)` runs Qwen3-VL locally to generate text from a prompt + optional `image` / `video` / `audio` input. Use it in-graph for captioning, VQA, or prompt generation / rewriting with no API call. Params: `max_tokens` (def 512), `temperature` 0.7, `top_k` 64, `top_p` 0.95. Template `llm_qwen3vl_text_gen.json`; weights `Comfy-Org/Qwen3-VL` (Apache-2.0). The local, no-cost counterpart to the in-graph Claude / API prompt nodes.
